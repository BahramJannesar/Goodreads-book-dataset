XDDon't get mad at me, but this book is my least favourite in Harry Potter series. it was kind of disappointment for me.3 years gap, reading the other fantastic books many times, guessing & looking forward to this one, to be greater than others as we are close to end.in one sentence: I was not satisfied after reading this one for the first time. (IK the book was the calm before the storm, but still.)& don't get me wrong; it was a disappointment Only compared to other HP books.Boring start. (2 chapters without anything related to Hogwarts or the golden trio)Harry was obsessed with what Malfoy was up to, the whole year & for the first time, I found Harry annoying. maybe this is the main reason I didn't like this book. (I hate 'Sectumsempra' chapter , always get mad at him. though now after many times re-read I actually find funny parts in it.)yelling many times at these kinds of parts:Don't!No!you idiot, Harry!btw, he is my favourite character.üíîat the end, he was right tho.also, lack of funny sarcastic verbal fights between Harry & Draco :(almost whole events were like side-jobs (like the Slug club; truth: I don't care about Slughorn either. those chapter he just talked & talked about celebrities once-were-his-students... ughhhh). Adrenaline peak parts were not satisfying (not a high peak) & not enough (amounts). the whole story was a bit ordinary & nothing happened in the whole school year, in particular. (like school wasn't at a grave danger (book 2, 3, 7 & maybe 5), the golden trio wasn't on solving mysteries (book 1, 4, 5) or something as fascinating as these. they were just attending their classes, boring parties, slug club & these normal stuff. XDbut in total, other parts, except Malfoy & Slug club; maybe not peak of adrenaline (as I said), but interesting, we all wanted to know who the half-blood prince was, Quidditch was funny & the parts with Dumbledore was fascinating.I liked the second half of the book , like finally this book stepped into action!But main reason: his obsession with Malfoy; 'OMG! Harry, just come off it!', therefore Harry being annoying, therefore lack of Harry's sarcasm comebacks with Malfoy, lowered this book to my least favourite.BUT....on the bright side, there are parts I love too:‚ù§ sassy Harry was the best! :DThere's no need to call me \"sir\", professor. Bless you JKR!Bless you Harry Potter!one of the sassiest comments in the history of sass master!my first reaction when I see this, was: \"omg! Harry! did you just...!?\" & then re-read the sentence to see if I got it right & then... putting the book down (\"Hail Harry Potter!\") & burst out laughing!\"Well, you can‚Äôt break an Unbreakable Vow...\" (Gee! Thanks Ron!)\"I‚Äôd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough!‚Äùalthough there was no sarcastic comebacks between Harry & Draco, but this book had many funny moments by many characters.Harry was not just being sassy & sarcastic but also being funny & clueless too, which was laughable.don't forget Ron making funny moments too.Ron's jokes with ghosts always made me choke because laughing so hard!\"and I'll take his secret to the ‚Äî\"  \"‚Äî not the grave, surely?\" said Ron with a snort. \"The sewers, maybe.\"LOL a lot!‚ù§ FriendshipsHarry & Ron's friendship (always one of my favourite brotps) funny, great, looking after each other. always love it, in all books.\"Nice,\" he said. \"Classy. You should definitely wear it in front of Fred and George.\"  \"If you tell them,\" said Ron, shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow, \"I ‚Äî I ‚Äî I‚Äôll ‚Äî\"  \"Stutter at me?\" said Harry, grinning. \"Come on, would I!?\"Roonil Wazlib!also Harry & Hermione's. (especially after Ron & Hermione's bickering), beautiful, caring, protective. again, I love it in all the books.‚ù§ my favourite chapters are \"the Cave\", \"the lightning-struck tower\" & \"Horcruxes\"; awesome, exciting with unexpected amount of surprises. I actually loved them.I loved the main-stream parts with Dumbledore.I loved how Harry, at some points, admired Tom.& how Harry unfolded this story & also sympathized with other characters.‚ù§ at least after that terrible mistake (mentioned above), the chapter ended beautifully; my favourite part, that magical romantic moment, how well described, what a glamorous scene. My first ship finally sinking! \"Harry looked around; there was (view spoiler)[Ginny (hide spoiler)] running toward him; she had a hard, blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him. And without thinking, without planning it, without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching, Harry kissed her. After several long moments, or it might have been half an hour-or possibly several sunlit days- they broke apart.The creature in his chest roaring in triumph.\"(& I was really angry when the movie CHANGED this scene! actually I really loved the first 3 movies (they were so similar to the books) & 5 too (tho it was a bit different & they mostly deleted the humor parts), 4 was similar enough, just darker than my imagination. but movies 6 & 7 just had the same quotes (almost) & changed or deleted scenes a lot, therefore those completely disappointed me. :(‚ù§ & I was proud Harry became (view spoiler)[Team Captain (hide spoiler)]!Quidditch were funny, especially the first one (You Clever Harry! XD). except not the commentator, but Harry made a funny moment of that too ;)‚ù§ Don't forget how Gracefully this book was written. (& how delicate she chose to show they were swearing without any direct swears, I love it, it doesn't make me apprehensive, on the contrary, it makes me laugh very hard & respect the pure talent.)Hail Queen!10th read; November 2019: I could've given 5 Stars because of Sassy Harry (I mean, Harry just being savagely Sassy this year! XD) & beautiful, magnificent choices of the words & compare to a few of my 5 stars this book definitely deserves 5; but I'm not satisfied with it so I probably won't. (yet) Although that's a progress, the rating score has risen to 4.5 now.-World building: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ/5Characters: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ/5/ Characters development: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ/5Written style: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ/5plot: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ/5General idea: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ/5",

        "Harry Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts. With Lord Voldemort on the loose things are going very bad in wizard community; all the troubles spill in the Muggle world. Unsurprisingly the book begins with a chapter with real Muggle Prime Minister - somewhat unnecessary I might add. If you think you can find anything original in this review you are sadly mistaken. It is practically impossible to find anything new to say after literally everybody and their brother read and discussed the series. Still itHarry Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts. With Lord Voldemort on the loose things are going very bad in wizard community; all the troubles spill in the Muggle world. Unsurprisingly the book begins with a chapter with real Muggle Prime Minister - somewhat unnecessary I might add. If you think you can find anything original in this review you are sadly mistaken. It is practically impossible to find anything new to say after literally everybody and their brother read and discussed the series. Still it was interesting to see some people try to pretend everything is fine and perfect (Hermione and Ron firmly fall into this category) while others like Harry being obsessed with suspecting other people - in Harry's case his suspicions of Draco Malfoy made him practically paranoid and acting retarded at times. Some spoilers follow. Is it still possible to find anybody who have not read the series or watched the movies? If you are one of such rarities, stop right here!!! Harry and Ginny romance came out of nowhere and feels very artificial. My old cynical self does not think Ginny is a good match for Harry. Why would anybody want to have a girlfriend whose only positive quality is to throw hexes around - for little or no reasons I might add? Hermione on the other hand was always there for Harry. Another complaint is fairly big and I will use spoiler tags for it. The underground lake scene: (view spoiler)[this came out really stupid for me. You had to drink the liquid to get the locket? You could not just reach it with you hand, fine. You could scoop the water with a goblet? Why not pour it out instead of drinking?  (hide spoiler)]Yet another big one: Snape (view spoiler)[Now that I know what is going on reading the second chapter I quite agree with Harry: he is probably the bravest man of the series. (hide spoiler)]The tragedy at the end still feels like a read tragedy during the reread while the impact of what happened at the end of the previous book considerably lessened when I read it the second time. So all the nitpicks aside I still rate this book with a perfect rating; it is well worth it. P.S. I always wanted to say it in one of the reviews for a book of the series; this feels like a good place: when it comes to movies, Richard Harris beats the crap out of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. I am not questioning the acting abilities of the latter, but the former suited to the role much better. I leave you with the following: ",
        "‚ÄúDo you remember me telling you we are practicing non-verbal spells, Potter?\"\"Yes,\" said Harry stiffly.\"Yes, sir.\"\"There's no need to call me \"sir\" Professor.\"The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying.‚Äù",
        "‚ÄúIt is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing .‚Äù",
        "\"Read Harry Potter!\" they said. \"It'll be fun!\" they said. \"Our childhood was built on Harry Potter!\" they said.WELL YOUR CHILDHOODS WERE ALL HORRIBLE. OMG WHAT IS THIS BOOK? WHAT IS THIS MESS I'M IN?? Excuse me, but that large salty lake where my life used to be is my tears. Yes, yes, this means I loved it. But SERIOUSLY. Nooooot okay. At the end there, especially, I couldn't put the audio down so I was wandering about my house in a blind daze listening instead.And because every human and their\"Read Harry Potter!\" they said. \"It'll be fun!\" they said. \"Our childhood was built on Harry Potter!\" they said.WELL YOUR CHILDHOODS WERE ALL HORRIBLE. OMG WHAT IS THIS BOOK? WHAT IS THIS MESS I'M IN?? Excuse me, but that large salty lake where my life used to be is my tears. Yes, yes, this means I loved it. But SERIOUSLY. Nooooot okay. At the end there, especially, I couldn't put the audio down so I was wandering about my house in a blind daze listening instead.And because every human and their fluffy poodle has probably sensibly reviewed this book, BAH. I'm just going to make a list of things I loved and things I didn't. My Intense And Passionate LOVES:‚Ä¢ Harry + Ginny = yes. I was dubious at first. Like I think romance is NOT JKR's strong point...plus when she gets to a romantic scene she ends the chapter. HHAHAH. ADORABLE. (Not that I minded, I just...I think she's not good at romance.) But omg, there was that moment after the Quidditch match??? YUP. You know what I'm talking about. Excuse me, my heart just ran around in circles screaming and shipping.‚Ä¢ Hermione: I adore her, but...I gotta admit, she was a little bit too stuffy. BUT I STILL LOVE HER. I love her love for learning.‚Ä¢ I also adore how sensible Ginny is. ‚Ä¢ Fred and George's joke shop gives life. Also death, probs, but liiiiife.‚Ä¢ I am utterly in LOVE with the whole concept of Hogwarts. I mean, I think it's stupid that they have to write with a quill and ink (can't they just enchant the quill to write for them?) and they seem to get an excessive amount of homework, BUT. It's all so vivid and detailed and it literally feels like Hogwarts is A REAL PLACE. I totally get why people wail about their letters going missing. ‚Ä¢ Speaking of detail...me likey. I always felt inside the story.‚Ä¢ Plus the audio book (narrated by Jim Dale) is GREAT. I totally recommend it. I think Hermione's voice had a tendency to sound like an insufferable goat, but I got used to it. Harry's voice was perfection. ‚Ä¢ I also particularly liked Harry in this book. I JUST LOVE HARRY. <3 He's snarky, but he's lost some of the angriness from bk 5. He's got snarky quips at the ready, but he's also intensely...good. Like he's just a really GOOD chap, who makes bad decisions but really means well. ZOMG. *flails about* He was definitely my favourite character in this book. ‚Ä¢ ALSO DUMBLEDORE WAS GREAT. I love Dumbledore and how he's always polite and kind and smiley. (view spoiler)[ CAN WE TALK A MINUT EHOW I'M NOT OKAY THAT HE'S DEAD?!??!?!? LIKE WHAT EVEN THE FLYING HECK OF BROOMS NEST TAILS. THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. BUT IT SHOULDN'T. BECAUSE NOTHING MAKES SENSE. Dumbledore. no. Come baaaaaaaack. *breaks down into a mess* I am also intensely furious that his weakening himself to get the horcrux was useless. MAD. Okay? I AM MAD. Character deaths where they failed are the worst there are.  (hide spoiler)]My Intense and Passionate LOATHES:(Hhahahha...you ready for this?)‚Ä¢ Okay so, question: WHY do they sometimes go places and buy food...and sometimes they just magic it? Like Mrs. Weasely magics onion soup out of nothing for Harry. But in the next chapter, Harry and Ron are peeling sprouts. LIKE WUT. This makes no sense to me. ‚Ä¢ Why didn't Dumbledore pour the evil potion on the ground instead of drinking it? Just wannna know...‚Ä¢ How the FLYING FRIKKIN BROOMSTICKS can anyone possibly convince me Snape is still on the good side? Because I don't even care. He can go abra kadabra himself to Timbuktu and DIE THERE THANKS. There is no repentance after this. I don't even care what the \"reason\" is in book 7, but Harry: you are an idiot to name your kid after Snape. ‚Ä¢ I HOPE SNAPE DIES.‚Ä¢ DID I MENTION MY HATE FOR SNAPE YET???????‚Ä¢ Oh and another thing...I am so angry at Snape arghhhqqwqq.‚Ä¢ Okay. Good now. I'm calm. Thank you. ‚Ä¢ HAHHAHHAHAHTE SNAPE.‚Ä¢ Yes, I truly am calm this time. I'm good.‚Ä¢ So. I also am fairly annoyed about Voldermort's (Tom Riddle) backstory. Because he read like he was straight out of a psychopath text book...which I found monstrously unimaginative. Attractive, calm, subtle bully, kleptomaniac, limited emotional reach, charmer, smooth...blah blah. Yes. I can just read a book about psychopaths and that's Voldey's description. I wish there'd been a little  ingenuity in there.‚Ä¢ I really also dislike Ron. I KNOW. Travesty. But he's a bully! He was bullying first year's the whole time...turfing tem off chairs, scaring them, bossing them around, taking stuff off them in the name of \"prefect\". Like how is that good?? How is that okay??? I will not forgive Ron for all this. And also the fact that he's a downright BRUTE to Hermione. How can I ship them when he's so rude and demeaning to her?? I DON'T. Hermione deserves better. And I don't buy the \"She completes him by sorting him out\" because I think all humans should take responsibility for their actions. Hermione shouldn't HAVE to force Ron into a better person and be his conscious. AGH. ‚Ä¢ Not shipping that. ^^‚Ä¢ Okay, I'm done. But just *whispers* I hate hate hate Snape. So basically YES, I had a fantastic time with this book. I loved the audio. I loved the story. I loved Harry and the world just feels so big and rich and visual. I get the intense fandom for this I DO GET IT. After being so angry and 1000% done in with book 3, I can successfully say I can't WAIT to read the last book now. And then watch all the movies. And then I'll finally be caught up, omg. Only took me like 10 years. ",

        "I was first introduced to Harry Potter in a Children‚Äôs Lit class in college. I had resisted this popular phenomenon until I was forced to pick it up for a grade, and Book 1 was short enough that I could read it in the course of 2 hours.

I had resisted this popular phenomenon until I was forced to pick it up for a grade, and Book 1 was short enough that I could read it in the course of 2 hours. I have to admit I wasn‚Äôt impressed to any extent, nor did I dislike the experience, but I was critical on grounds of its being derivative, even if reading the first led to reading the second. After all, if I was bored and looking for something light, I could do worse than a fantasy about a child wizard who fights evil with his friends. But it was really the third book, with its increasing darkness, that took me in and made me a fan. With a movie coming out for Order of Phoenix and Deathly Hallows on the horizon, I decided I would reread Half-Blood Prince. I figured it would take four sittings, of course, with its 600 pages, but time does fly when reading this one, and I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that this is my favorite so far. What I wouldn‚Äôt have been willing to admit in college that I‚Äôm perfectly comfortable saying now is that J.K. Rowling is a fantastic storyteller; she writes with great clarity, wit, and humor; and she‚Äôs created a cast of loveable characters with whom most people, due to the common experience of growing up, can relate closely. That said, the reason for my preference for the 6th book is that it‚Äôs the most emotionally rich in the series. Here we get the backstory of Voldemort (*spoiler alert*) through a series of flashbacks (coming in HP by way of magically extracted memories), and in this way, we come to understand the villain‚Äôs similarities and differences with our hero. After all, the villain has to have reasons for committing heinous acts, and until now, we don‚Äôt know what these are.Voldemort is from a once-powerful wizard family reduced to poverty that lives in a dilapidated hovel on the edge of a small town, wary of outsiders, and their main point of pride is their pure blood, the lineage having cross-bred for generations so as not to pollute the line. Voldemort‚Äôs mother lives with her father and brother and yearns for the love of a nonmagical man (‚Äúmuggle‚Äù in this world) and when her father and brother are arrested, she uses the opportunity to bewitch her beloved and run off. She ends up pregnant, the man deserts her, and she dies while giving birth to her half-wizard, half-muggle son, thus making him an orphan (like Harry).(Faulkner anyone?)But whereas Harry comes to Hogwarts and befriends Ron and Hermione creating unity and strength through positive emotions, Voldemort, when growing in the orphanage shuns other children, torturing them at times (without the awareness of adults) and stealing their possessions. What fuels him is his hatred of his beginnings, his mother‚Äôs weakness at having died like a common person despite being a witch, and the ‚Äúmuggle‚Äù blood inherited from his father. Over the course of his time at Hogwarts, Voldemort, charming as only evil can be, learns to win over people as a means to an end and disguise his insidious purposes, but he never befriends anyone. He moves, through his hatred, further away from many of the emotions that drive Harry, namely the desire to protect the people he loves and avenge his parents‚Äô death.With Dumbledore‚Äôs help in exploring Voldemort‚Äôs past, Harry begins to understand that he‚Äôs come to be where he is through the choices he‚Äôs made, that his greatest strengths are an alliance with his friends, and that this might hold the key to destroying his enemy, a fact that‚Äôs made all the  poignant when Dumbledore, in an all-out assault on Hogwarts by Voldemort‚Äôs Death Eaters, is killed at the end. The stakes are higher than before, the action and pace increase as the conclusion draws near, and things are looking darker than ever, which is the setup that any fan wants when the end is looming and it leaves us with the question: How will our hero prevail?",

I don't know what it is, I just feel like a proud mom.-ALL OF THE TOM RIDDLE BACKSTORY. THE GAUNT HOUSE. OMG. I literally need a whole book about Tom Riddle's life. That would make me happy.-While reading this book, there were about a hundred times when I was just amazed by irony at the whole Snape/Half-Blood Prince situation. (Harry is always going on about how great the Prince is and how terrible Snape is, etc.) I loved it!-\"Tom used to collect trophies,\" said Dumbledore, \"This will be important later.\" WHY COULDN'T HE HAVE JUST EXPLAINED HORCRUXES TO HARRY THEN? COME ON MANNNNN.-the fact that Voldemort went back to Hogwarts to ask for a job just.... is hilarious to me. I'm picturing a sort of weird looking Tom Riddle like \"plz. im evil but i luv hogwartz\"-when you find out that the Defence Against the Dark Arts job is actually cursed *thumbs up*-\"I love you, Hermione.\" RON ACTUALLY SAID THOSE WORDS. HE SAID THEM AND MY HEART SANG. He meant it in a friendly way but Hermione definitely loved hearing it.-Harry and Ginny are both so sassy and I love it when they become sassy together <3-at the end when Hagrid said something along the lines of \"Dumbledore will be able to fix it\" right after Harry saw him die.... Saddest thing ever.This book and its movie are definitely up there on my favorites list.",

'I heard him telling your mum, Ron.' I'm really enjoying this series so far but this series gets darker and darker. the first three of this series were so funny and cute even though there were sad scenes on them and the fourth, fifth and sixth books contained so much pain and I even shed  tears for these book than I did for the the first three. I have lost a favorite character that always made me laugh and smile. this character is Sirus Black. I even still can't get over his death. but let's admit it that maybe there's a death of character that we will never get over.*takes deep breath* okay let's talk about this book „Éª„ÄÇ„Éª„Çú‚òÖ„Éª„ÄÇ„Éª„ÄÇ‚òÜ„Éª„Çú„Éª„ÄÇ„Éª„Çú„ÄÇ„Éª„ÄÇ„Éª„Çú‚òÖ„Éª„ÄÇ„Éª„ÄÇ‚òÜ„Éª„ÄÇ„Éª„Çú‚òÖ„Éª„ÄÇ„Éª„ÄÇPHLEGM I have never liked Fleur Delacour very much since I first saw her on the book four and then I saw her again on the book four as Bill's girlfriend or Fiancee and I also laughed when Ginny called Fleur Phlegm. I also still don't how Bill fell in love with her but yeah, she is pretty but I thought Bill deserved someone better than her. I like Bill so much. he is so cool with his red long hair. maybe I didn't like Phlegm because I was jealous hahahaha okay it is not maybe, I was jealous. but look at this scene : ''E is always so thoughtful,' purred Fleur adoringly, stroking Bill's nose. Ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind Fleur. Harry choked over his cornflakes and Ron thumped him on the back.ugh ... how could I like her if she acted like that?!? that was really annoying and Ginny also found it disgusting. Hermione and Ginny didn't even like her. but she changed my mind on the the end of this book because when Bill was attacked by ... that werewolf guy who bit Remus when he was a kid. Bill is no longer as handsome as he used to be but Fleur still loves him. she doesn't care about how he looks and I even thought she would leave him after he was attacked but she didn't and that time I changed my mind about her. She is the right girl for Bill, even though I am a little bit jealous hahaha xD Ron and HermioneI ship these two so much and I really really like Ron. Ron and Hermione are always funny. they always bicker about something and I think the first time Ron fell in love with Hermione was on the book four because he was so angry when he knew Hermione went to the Yule Ball with Viktor Krum and in this book Ron hurt me so much. He thought that Hermione kissed Krum and he was so angry and jealous because of this and he kissed Lavender in the common room that was full of people and it also broke Hermione's heart. Harry looked into the corner she was indicating. There, in full view of the whole room, stood Ron wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose.And I was so angry in that moment 'Er - my - nee,' croaked Ron unexpectedly from between them. but all my anger was gone when he was poisoned and he said that while he was asleep. I think he was trying to say Hermione, so that meant he dreamt about her and I forgave him that exact time and he also didn't really like Lavender any since then. he even pretended to be asleep when Lavender came to visit him in the hospital wing. so that meant he didn't like her any and I don't think he actually liked Lavender before he was poisoned. I think he just kissed Lavender because he wanted to make Hermione jealous and feel hurt, which he successfully did. Harry And Ginnyhave you ever thought why Ginny had relationship with quite many guys? wait ... not many guys because she just dated two boys, Dean and Michael. But she always got a boyfriend as soon as she split up with her ex and my thoughs about this is probably right because Ginny said this to Harry on the end of the book  'I never really gave up on you,' she said. 'Not really. I always hoped ... Hermione told me to get on with life, maybe go out with some other people, relax a bit around you, because I never used to be able to talk if you were in the room, remember? And she thought you might take a bit  notice if I was a bit  - myself.' I think Ginny always dated a guy as soon as she split up with her ex because she always tried to forget Harry, so maybe if she had a boyfriend, she wouldn't love Harry any. But according to what she said she never really gave up on Harry so that means she has always loved him. I was a bit sad when Harry said they can't be together again because Harry was afraid if something would happen to Ginny if they kept seeing each other. he was afraid if Voldemort used Ginny to get him. but I didn't angry with him because this just proved how much Harry loves Ginny and I am sure they will be together again. I hope so ... Dumbledore's deathI admit that Dumbledore is not one of my top favorite characters in this series but I always found him funny and a bit weird, in a good way, of course. But his death left me in shock because he was actually pleading to Snape but Snape killed him with The Avada Kedavra curse and I thought Snape was on the good side. What will happen now after Dumbledore died?! He is the only one Voldemort is afraid of. I have this feeling that I'll to lose my favorite characters again ... thank you so much for reading and liking my review. hope you all have a great weekend, guys! ",

Well, deep or shallow, it's the truth. I waited a long time to read the Harry Potter books because I wanted to experience them with my own children. My son (8) and I just finished the sixth book, my first daughter (6) and I are working on the first, and my youngest child (3) is content to commandeer her siblings' wands and run around shrieking, \"I have a Harry Potter stick!\"In other words, we all enjoy it.I could write a great deal about Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, but it's a tough book to write about without giving things away. And though I loved this novel for many reasons, I find it quite difficult to separate it from the other tales. This, I think, speaks to J.K. Rowling's ability to connect the stories in a such a way that they each have their own identity while still continuing to trace a gigantic glowing arc through the sky along which the reader is able to ride from the first book to the seventh.So before I tell you a few things I loved about the novel, please know that there might be spoilers below. Not huge spoilers, mind you, but I'm always afraid of letting something slip. So...be forewarned. Don't read on if you haven't read this book yet. And if you haven't read the book, why are you reading a review of it by a writer whose skills don't yet approach J.K. Rowling's? Seriously. Get off the danged Internet and read this amazing series!Some delights and terrors and sorrows...1. Fenrir Greyback: Bet that surprised you a little. I know that this character played a relatively minor role, but on the page he was a scene-stealer, a flesh-chewer, and a perfect foil for one of my favorite characters, Remus Lupin.An aside: About a year before I began reading the series, my Creative Writing class was discussing characterization. The kids began talking about the Harry Potter books. One remarked that the supporting characters were as interesting as the leads, which led another student to bring up Remus Lupin. She was halfway through her cataloging of his merits as a character when she stopped and looked up at me, as if seeing me anew. She then said, \"Mr. (Insert real name here). You sort of remind me of Lupin.\" When I later found out he was a werewolf, I was a little bit shocked (and secretly pleased). But when I really got to know the character, I found the remark incredibly gratifying.Back to Fenrir Greyback (with whom I hope I have nothing in common)...What made Greyback so incredibly interesting to me was not only the sheer ferocity of his behavior, but the diabolical simplicity of his motives. If the Harry Potter books were likened to Lord of the Flies and Voldemort's ambition were compared with Jack's (the leader of the hunters), then Greyback would be Roger, the sadist. This powderkeg of a character lives only to rend flesh and to guzzle the steaming lifeblood of his victims. Greyback doesn't want to rule the world; he simply wants to terrorize it. I don't know what kind of a role he plays in the seventh book (if any), but his unreasoning brutality added just the right note of menace to a book that largely---and sensitively---focused on the romantic relationships of its teenagers.2. Fleur's Surprising Reaction: I admit to falling prey to a stupid prejudice here, and I feel awful about it. But I wrongly assumed Fleur Delacour was a pretty face without a soul. In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire she was the object of many male desires (Ron's particularly), and though she was skilled at wizardry, she wasn't an especially affecting character. She did seem affected, however, and when she showed up again in Book Six, I, like Mrs. Weasley, rolled my eyes and dismissed her as a fluttery, vapid future supermodel.How wrong I was.One mark of a great writer, I think, is the ability to surprise the reader without cheating. That's J.K. Rowling. When something terrible befell Fleur's fiance, I was all set to mentally berate her for her superficiality. But rather than making a caricature out of Fleur---as I fear I unknowingly did---Rowling transformed her and made her deeply endearing with a couple elegant lines of dialogue.And I loved that. So here's to continual reminders to not judge people by appearances or even their seeming personalities. People can still surprise us, and we need to give them the opportunity to do so.*takes a deep breath*And lastly...3. Dumbledore: If you've read this far, you've only been assailed by minor spoilers. I don't want to spoil this plot twist, but I don't know how to talk about it without spoiling it. And the fact is, I don't want to talk about it.Rarely has a fictional character so resonated with me the way Albus Dumbledore has. In the first book he was wise, eccentric, and a constant source of comfort. As the series has developed, he has persisted in exhibiting those traits, but he has also grown  than most might think. He has revealed a penchant for trusting others too much. He has admitted how fallible he is, how prone to mistakes. He has been injured, accused of wrongdoing, and generally fed through a physical and emotional woodchipper.And he has come through it all with an open, caring heart and an enormous capacity for love. One passage in particular, I think, summarizes this amazing character for me. In a scene that chronicles how Tom Riddle became Lord Voldemort, Dumbledore attempts to gird Harry's resolve and confidence in the inevitable battle with his nemesis:\"Yes, you have,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"You have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can---\"\"I know!\" said Harry impatiently. \"I can love!\" It was only with difficult that he stopped himself adding, \"Big deal!\"\"Yes, Harry, you can love,\" said Dumbledore, who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying. \"Which, given everything that has happened to you, is a great and remarkable thing. You are still too young to understand how unusual you are, Harry.\"\"So, when the prophecy says that I'll have 'power the Dark Lord knows not,' it just means---love?\" asked Harry, feeling a little let down.\"Yes---just love,\" said Dumbledore.The above passage will strike some as too direct, too naive, or worst of all, too emotional.It struck me as incredibly beautiful. There are all sorts of belief systems in the world, and no two people are exactly alike in their beliefs. But what Dumbledore says here is something that, were it adopted by  people, would alter our world for the better. Harry, for all his flaws, usually acts with good intentions. He befriends Luna Lovegood (another one of my favorite characters in all of fiction), gives of himself to others, and is willing to suffer so that others won't have to experience the same pain. In other words, Harry loves.And so can Dumbledore. Which is why this book was so memorable, wonderful, and painful to me.I'm going to go now. My wife is making a delicious supper. My son and first daughter are ready to wrestle. And my three-year-old is racing around the house casting spells on the furniture with her Harry Potter stick.And for that, J.K. Rowling, I thank you.",
        "It seems like by now, everyone would realize they should listen to Harry..Such a sad end :( I knew that was going to happen before starting the series, but didn't know when. It still got me in the feels, though.The book as a whole was really fun and entertaining. I love the mystery and learning  about Voldemort. The romance drama was funny as well.I can't wait to see what adventures the next book brings and how it all concludes..",

So, my dear underside-of-a-rock-residing friends: review will be interesting, because this book was far (far, far) from perfect, and yet I am utterly determined to give it 5 stars. (Which I have only given to the first book in this series.)God, how do you talk about this book? It‚Äôs really amazing. It is really hard for me to feel anything while reading a book or generally living my life. For example, I felt nothing when Sirius died. Nothing throughout most of this series, actually. And nothing in this book, because nothing happened and everyone survived and everything is sunshiney and joyful!Ugh. I tried. The last hundred-ish pages of this book really tore me apart. Okay, even that‚Äôs not true. I‚Äôll just come out and say it: I‚Äôm really f*cking sad that Dumbledore died. I love him so much. He‚Äôs high up in my top 5 characters. (Do I even have a top 5?) I‚Äôm devastated, which makes me even  upset, because I have a life to live today and can‚Äôt just lay around and wallow in fictional pain.I‚Äôm going to move on in the hopes that I just. Forget. Because I don‚Äôt like this at ALL.Here, we see Harry Potter - who, I think few will argue, has been a fairly mediocre character up to this point - become AMAZING. He‚Äôs motivated solely by his need to work against injustice and evil. He realizes his parents‚Äô legacy within himself. He denounces the sucking up of others. He works hard in school! He is a good friend even when his two BFFS are being childish to one another plus refusing to believe him. In short, he‚Äôs really, really, five-star-level great here. Gorgeous character development in 650 pages.I didn‚Äôt think I liked Ginny much, because I didn‚Äôt remember this book well...like, at all. But she is so great! So funny. I wish there was  of her in this book.Also, I‚Äôll fight anyone who says Dumbledore is ~the real villain~ of this series. He‚Äôs really not. (Cough, Snape is, cough.) AND YOU'RE NOT EDGY, PEOPLE WHO HATE DUMBLEDORE BUT LOVE SNAPE. YOU'RE JUST DUMB. I fell deeply in love with the guy. (Dumbledore, not Snape. BLEH.) AND I F*CKING MISS HIM. Goddamn it. Trying to forget didn‚Äôt last very long. Anyway.I missed Hermione and Neville. Hermione was absolutely not well-represented here at all. Maybe it‚Äôs a good thing she‚Äôs not a Ravenclaw (#RavenclawPride) because she works fully against logic throughout this book. And when she‚Äôs not she just, like, refuses to believe Harry.Ron is soooooooooo annoying! Is he anyone‚Äôs favorite character? He‚Äôs like, Fred or George if one of them was totally childish and attention-starved and mean. In fact, Ronald is a pretty impressive character for the number of gross character traits he embodies despite being supposed to be a good character. Mean, immature, rude, jealous, definition of an inferiority complex. Bleh.Harry and Ginny I‚Äôm totally for, BUT THE OTHER RELATIONSHIPS IN THIS BOOK ARE SO BORING. Can we do Hermione and Fred instead? Ron and Luna would be cute. Or, God forbid, some LGBT representation? WE KNOW YOU‚ÄôRE A SUPPORTER, JOANNE. Don‚Äôt even get me started on Lupin and Tonks.Speaking of supposedly-good characters‚Äô downfalls: I‚Äôm no longer a Hagrid fan. It started with the last book and came fully around here. Like, at a certain point, the man needs a character trait. Liking weird animals, making bad food, and being humongous don‚Äôt count. Harry and Hermione‚Äôs constant stubbornness is annoying. Plus makes the plot repetitive once in a while. Also, Tonks. You know what, I guess I AM going to get started on Lupin and Tonks! She was a hilarious badass in the last book, totally depressed and weak in this one. I know I sound like a total emotionless asshole here, but that‚Äôs who I am, and she‚Äôs annoying in this book. AND IT‚ÄôS TOTALLY FINE BECAUSE SHE‚ÄôS JUST BEING A SPINELESS IDIOT OVER SOME DUMB SHABBY MAN. Kill me, please. Then I can see my beloved Dumbledore again.Too much Snape. (Cannot WAIT to write the rant on him.) Too much Draco. (Why do people romanticize that little weirdo so much? I guess I get the temptation, but he‚Äôs a bully at best and a spineless traitor at worst.) I hate Kreacher and I hate Dobby...I hated Winky, too...I might hate house elves. If that makes me racist against a species of fictional character, SO BE IT, I GUESS.I miss Fred and George, and the fun people from the Order (if they existed), and Hermione and Neville aren‚Äôt here nearly enough. The price of Harry‚Äôs amazing and concise character development is WAY too many bad characters, not nearly enough of the good ones. EXCEPT DUMBLEDORE. UGHHHH. I‚ÄôM SO SAD. (I think my inability to cry is making this worse. Maybe if I just creepily sobbed in front of my roommate for a few minutes I‚Äôd feel better. Damn you, my lack of emotions! Just kidding love you.)But I want to give this book five stars  than anything. It was so compulsively readable,  than any other book since the first for me. And it‚Äôs the last book where our pals are attending Hogwarts. That makes me so sad. It‚Äôs such a gorgeous setting and I‚Äôm going to miss it so much. WHY IS THIS BOOK SO SAD?! If Deathly Hallows is any sadder I‚Äôll be seriously impressed. And also seriously screwed.And, okay, even though I was a harsh critic of these books...I‚Äôm really going to miss this series. I‚Äôve been rereading it on and off (obviously) for three months, and it‚Äôs been a fun ride. This is one of the greatest settings of all time. And since I‚Äôm rereading it after 10 years, it‚Äôs like saying goodbye twice. AND I HATE ENDINGS.Bottom line: Okay, THIS is my favorite Harry Potter book. (Anyone else‚Äôs?) Unreal character development + tragic and lovely adieu to a gorgeous setting + ability to make me feel real, deep emotion + compulsively readable? An absolute dream.----------ORIGINAL REVIEW---------------Ron and Hermione's will-they-won't-they is a total snoozefest. I propose Fred & Hermione and Ron & Luna instead. Also seven  books!",

Finally, as a simple tribute to the wisest, kindest, most revered and one of the most powerful wizards (whose death out of the many deaths hurts me the most that I cried so much, I may have cried harder than Hagrid), the following is a collection of a few of his great thoughts and words that‚Äôll be forever etched in our hearts. *sniffs*  ‚ÄúIn fact, being-forgive me- rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.‚Äù  ‚ÄúPeople find it a lot easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIt does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.‚Äù   ‚ÄúWords are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic.

XDDon't get mad at me, but this book is my least favourite in Harry Potter series. it was kind of disappointment for me.3 years gap, reading the other fantastic books many times, guessing & looking forward to this one, to be greater than others as we are close to end.in one sentence: I was not satisfied after reading this one for the first time. (IK the book was the calm before the storm, but still.)& don't get me wrong; it was a disappointment Only compared to other HP books.Boring start. (2 chapters without anything related to Hogwarts or the golden trio)Harry was obsessed with what Malfoy was up to, the whole year & for the first time, I found Harry annoying. maybe this is the main reason I didn't like this book. (I hate 'Sectumsempra' chapter , always get mad at him. though now after many times re-read I actually find funny parts in it.)yelling many times at these kinds of parts:Don't!No!you idiot, Harry!btw, he is my favourite character.üíîat the end, he was right tho.also, lack of funny sarcastic verbal fights between Harry & Draco :(almost whole events were like side-jobs (like the Slug club; truth: I don't care about Slughorn either. those chapter he just talked & talked about celebrities once-were-his-students... ughhhh). Adrenaline peak parts were not satisfying (not a high peak) & not enough (amounts). the whole story was a bit ordinary & nothing happened in the whole school year, in particular. (like school wasn't at a grave danger (book 2, 3, 7 & maybe 5), the golden trio wasn't on solving mysteries (book 1, 4, 5) or something as fascinating as these. they were just attending their classes, boring parties, slug club & these normal stuff. XDbut in total, other parts, except Malfoy & Slug club; maybe not peak of adrenaline (as I said), but interesting, we all wanted to know who the half-blood prince was, Quidditch was funny & the parts with Dumbledore was fascinating.I liked the second half of the book , like finally this book stepped into action!But main reason: his obsession with Malfoy; 'OMG! Harry, just come off it!', therefore Harry being annoying, therefore lack of Harry's sarcasm comebacks with Malfoy, lowered this book to my least favourite.BUT....on the bright side, there are parts I love too:‚ù§ sassy Harry was the best! :DThere's no need to call me \"sir\", professor. Bless you JKR!Bless you Harry Potter!one of the sassiest comments in the history of sass master!my first reaction when I see this, was: \"omg! Harry! did you just...!?\" & then re-read the sentence to see if I got it right & then... putting the book down (\"Hail Harry Potter!\") & burst out laughing!\"Well, you can‚Äôt break an Unbreakable Vow...\" (Gee! Thanks Ron!)\"I‚Äôd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough!‚Äùalthough there was no sarcastic comebacks between Harry & Draco, but this book had many funny moments by many characters.Harry was not just being sassy & sarcastic but also being funny & clueless too, which was laughable.don't forget Ron making funny moments too.Ron's jokes with ghosts always made me choke because laughing so hard!\"and I'll take his secret to the ‚Äî\"  \"‚Äî not the grave, surely?\" said Ron with a snort. \"The sewers, maybe.\"LOL a lot!‚ù§ FriendshipsHarry & Ron's friendship (always one of my favourite brotps) funny, great, looking after each other. always love it, in all books.\"Nice,\" he said. \"Classy. You should definitely wear it in front of Fred and George.\"  \"If you tell them,\" said Ron, shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow, \"I ‚Äî I ‚Äî I‚Äôll ‚Äî\"  \"Stutter at me?\" said Harry, grinning. \"Come on, would I!?\"Roonil Wazlib!also Harry & Hermione's. (especially after Ron & Hermione's bickering), beautiful, caring, protective. again, I love it in all the books.‚ù§ my favourite chapters are \"the Cave\", \"the lightning-struck tower\" & \"Horcruxes\"; awesome, exciting with unexpected amount of surprises. I actually loved them.I loved the main-stream parts with Dumbledore.I loved how Harry, at some points, admired Tom.& how Harry unfolded this story & also sympathized with other characters.‚ù§ at least after that terrible mistake (mentioned above), the chapter ended beautifully; my favourite part, that magical romantic moment, how well described, what a glamorous scene. My first ship finally sinking! \"Harry looked around; there was (view spoiler)[Ginny (hide spoiler)] running toward him; she had a hard, blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him. And without thinking, without planning it, without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching, Harry kissed her. After several long moments, or it might have been half an hour-or possibly several sunlit days- they broke apart.The creature in his chest roaring in triumph.\"(& I was really angry when the movie CHANGED this scene! actually I really loved the first 3 movies (they were so similar to the books) & 5 too (tho it was a bit different & they mostly deleted the humor parts), 4 was similar enough, just darker than my imagination. but movies 6 & 7 just had the same quotes (almost) & changed or deleted scenes a lot, therefore those completely disappointed me. :(‚ù§ & I was proud Harry became (view spoiler)[Team Captain (hide spoiler)]!Quidditch were funny, especially the first one (You Clever Harry! XD). except not the commentator, but Harry made a funny moment of that too ;)‚ù§ Don't forget how Gracefully this book was written. (& how delicate she chose to show they were swearing without any direct swears, I love it, it doesn't make me apprehensive, on the contrary, it makes me laugh very hard & respect the pure talent.)Hail Queen!10th read; November 2019: I could've given 5 Stars because of Sassy Harry (I mean, Harry just being savagely Sassy this year! XD) & beautiful, magnificent choices of the words & compare to a few of my 5 stars this book definitely deserves 5; but I'm not satisfied with it so I probably won't. (yet) Although that's a progress, the rating score has risen to 4.5 now.-World building: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ/5Characters: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ/5/ Characters development: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ/5Written style: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ/5plot: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ/5General idea: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ/5",

        "Harry Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts. With Lord Voldemort on the loose things are going very bad in wizard community; all the troubles spill in the Muggle world. Unsurprisingly the book begins with a chapter with real Muggle Prime Minister - somewhat unnecessary I might add. If you think you can find anything original in this review you are sadly mistaken. It is practically impossible to find anything new to say after literally everybody and their brother read and discussed the series. Still itHarry Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts. With Lord Voldemort on the loose things are going very bad in wizard community; all the troubles spill in the Muggle world. Unsurprisingly the book begins with a chapter with real Muggle Prime Minister - somewhat unnecessary I might add. If you think you can find anything original in this review you are sadly mistaken. It is practically impossible to find anything new to say after literally everybody and their brother read and discussed the series. Still it was interesting to see some people try to pretend everything is fine and perfect (Hermione and Ron firmly fall into this category) while others like Harry being obsessed with suspecting other people - in Harry's case his suspicions of Draco Malfoy made him practically paranoid and acting retarded at times. Some spoilers follow. Is it still possible to find anybody who have not read the series or watched the movies? If you are one of such rarities, stop right here!!! Harry and Ginny romance came out of nowhere and feels very artificial. My old cynical self does not think Ginny is a good match for Harry. Why would anybody want to have a girlfriend whose only positive quality is to throw hexes around - for little or no reasons I might add? Hermione on the other hand was always there for Harry. Another complaint is fairly big and I will use spoiler tags for it. The underground lake scene: (view spoiler)[this came out really stupid for me. You had to drink the liquid to get the locket? You could not just reach it with you hand, fine. You could scoop the water with a goblet? Why not pour it out instead of drinking?  (hide spoiler)]Yet another big one: Snape (view spoiler)[Now that I know what is going on reading the second chapter I quite agree with Harry: he is probably the bravest man of the series. (hide spoiler)]The tragedy at the end still feels like a read tragedy during the reread while the impact of what happened at the end of the previous book considerably lessened when I read it the second time. So all the nitpicks aside I still rate this book with a perfect rating; it is well worth it. P.S. I always wanted to say it in one of the reviews for a book of the series; this feels like a good place: when it comes to movies, Richard Harris beats the crap out of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. I am not questioning the acting abilities of the latter, but the former suited to the role much better. I leave you with the following: ",
        "‚ÄúDo you remember me telling you we are practicing non-verbal spells, Potter?\"\"Yes,\" said Harry stiffly.\"Yes, sir.\"\"There's no need to call me \"sir\" Professor.\"The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying.‚Äù",

I cannot remember enjoying this book as much as I did now. I actually thought this was one of my least favorite in the series but now I‚Äôve realized that it‚Äôs actually one of my favorites. I liked this book much  than the fifth and read it much faster. I have no idea why but I found many parts in this book funny. I laughed a lot  than usual when I read Harry Potter books. This book was perfect and amazing in every way possible. My second favorite character in the series is Draco and in this book, I felt so bad for him. He probably wouldn‚Äôt have gone off to the dark side if his dad wasn't there first. It was obvious that he and his mother didn‚Äôt want to follow Voldemort. When he hesitated to kill Dumbledore and was considering taking his offer of leaving the dark side I felt so bad for him. Also in the bathroom when he was crying really made me feel sorry for him because I don‚Äôt think he would be all rude and mean if it wasn‚Äôt for his parents and the way he was brought up. Harry and Ginny. To me, they should have never been a thing. I have always hated Ginny and the fact that Harry starts to like her annoys me so much. I hated her from the beginning and I have no idea why. I always wanted Harry with Hermione and not with Ron but my ships always crash. But then again Hermione is way too smart for Harry and Ron. Harry being with Ginny slightly rubbed off on me after re-reading this book, but keyword being slightly. Although, I still don‚Äôt like Ginny and I don‚Äôt think I ever will. I always disliked her since the beginning and I also don't think I will be completely okay with them together. This book proves that Harry Potter is an idiot and there was a reason he was never put in Ravenclaw. I mentioned this in my review of the first book but one day my friend and I were talking about HP and she told about how Harry is so dumb. First of all, Snape has been teaching him for 5 years. 5 YEARS yet Harry wasn‚Äôt able to recognize his handwriting. I cannot understand how Harry could not pick it up. I mean Snape had been his teacher for 5 years and was writing in front of them yet Harry couldn't put two and two together. Hermione probably could have figured it out but she never read the book. Does he not pay attention at all? I mean you‚Äôd have to never listen or read anything in class to not pick it up.After he finds this book, which has spells written around it, he thinks it's perfectly fine to start using them. This book obviously belonged to someone who was a dark wizard but yet he sees these spells and thinks ‚Äòoh nothing bad should happen I mean this book only was written by someone who was interested in the darks arts‚Äô. Then he decides to test a spell on Draco and he doesn‚Äôt even know what the spell does. I get Draco was trying to torture him with the Cruciatus Curse but there are still other spells he could have used to stop him. Then he tries to convince Snape that his nickname is Roonil Wazlib. Obviously, Snape won't fall for that. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love this series and I do like Harry but he is so stupid.I enjoyed this book a lot and found it really funny. I feel like reading this book made me love the series  and I‚Äôm not sure if that was even possible. I wish after finishing the series I can erase my mind and re-read the series. I am so excited to carry on even though I know what happens next. I want to wait for a little before carrying on to the last book because I don't want to finish re-reading the series. I don‚Äôt want it to end becuase I‚Äôm so obsessed with this series!!!",

The stillness that accompanies sitting with your own thoughts during the countless rest days is painstakingly growing on me, so I needed something to look forward to, other than the many family-talks speculating about what's ahead.I'm giving myself permission to sidetrack first into a bit of a backstory, given that this book did the same with its¬†rather long \"Previously on Harry Potter\" starting point,¬†catching the reader up on the 411.Back in late 2014 -¬†THE year I started reading Harry Potter for the first time and the same year I promised myself I'd finish the series - I made the hefty mistake of picking up the fifth book,       Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  , from the library on its own right before Hanukkah, meaning that the sequel wouldn't be available for another week. I then dutifully devoured the fifth book by day two and convinced my mom that the only thing I wanted, nay needed, was the sequel, which I promptly completed in time to take the finale from the library.(Spoilers: I finished the series with two days to spare of 2014 in which I also finished¬†To All the Boys I‚Äôve Loved Before¬†to provide me some of that lightheartedness, as I mention in my review.)I personally had a rocky start with reading the series. The first book took me multiple times to pick up and complete; it took me months of what I usually read within a week. I remember now really getting into the series with the fourth and fifth book, though I can't recall now which works better in my favor.    Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  ¬†is probably my favorite because I'm a sucker for dreams and nightmares being interpreted and taken seriously. The minute you start paying attention that's when you start seeing  clear signs that can easily give answers to your own personal situation.This sixth book seemed promising to me, as well, because of¬†the Pensieve and its many memories we dive into. This is the only way to do flashbacks... especially given the unbiased perspective to these unfolding events, like getting an introduction into Voldemort's family line from someone employed by the Department of Magical Law Enforcement,¬†and then slowly piecing together bits of information through the many reveals.But before all that can happen, the book starts off where Harry feels most at peace: The Burrow. I love me some good ol' family dynamics with the Weasleys (and being a united front against¬†Phlegm¬†Fleur).‚ÄúWell, all I can say is that it was a lucky day for the Weasleys when Ron decided to sit in your compartment on the Hogwarts Express, Harry.‚ÄùHarry is slowly starting to view Ginny as a safe haven; she represents all good and safety in the world for Harry, which he desperately seeks with the upheaval that is his own life. I laughed when my mind associated Harry's choice of Ginny Weasley with that scene from Parks and Rec with the Saperstein twins:Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince  ¬†centers on the  obsessed-like state of Harry with Malfoy, Hermione sulking away from Won-Won, Roonil Wazlib making a mighty comeback, the frustration when no one believes Harry's valid suspicions, and so much  which I feature¬†below in my favorite points:‚Ä¢ The sly insert when Slughorn dismisses Ron's name with:¬†‚Äú...after what happened to your poor friend Rupert.‚Äù Clearly, filming for the Harry Potter series was well underway.‚Ä¢ This particular book in the series feels like the inspiration behind Baz and Simon in Fangirl (and Carry On) what with the slow-moving plot till the characters arrive onto school grounds, and the aforementioned nemesis-watching from afar and following their every move.‚ÄúLevi sat back, hugging the pillow again. ‚ÄúThey are kind of gay, aren‚Äôt they? What with all the watching each other sleep¬†‚Ä¶ and the ignoring Penelope.‚ÄùI'm personally not into the whole Draco/Harry ship, given Draco literally smashed Harry's face in just because (this ruthlessness is what's so vivid in my mind, so much so that the hurt of that scene traveled through back four years when I first read it and I felt the exact same shock) and also the simple fact that Draco Malfoy is a terribly cruel character. Those types need to stray far, far from humans until they acquire some anger management tools. He's basically a reincarnation of Snape (the only reason they get along) what with all the sulking and pettiness (Snape with Lily, and Draco with his need to acquire power). Just because you've marked a certain person/goal as \"MINE\" in your head doesn't make it so it's yours. So the author trying to make me feel sorry for either of them won't work in my favor. Like, \"Woe is me. All I want is the approval of the Dark Lord.\"It's also the reason why I'm not rushing to reread the following book given the frustrations whenever an author dismisses the actions of an evil character, like Snape, for \"Oh, Love...\" You've painted your picture for the whole series, making us not only hate but despise Severus Snape, so you can't just drop this pent-up anger with one scene in the seventh book. Snape \"loving\" ( like, marking his territory) a certain someone who chooses not to settle for him doesn't justify his following actions, no matter what storyline tries to redeem him.‚Ä¢ The one thing that really settled with me was when Harry and Dumbledore were discussing¬†destiny and \"the¬†prophecy\" and how it's neither here nor there: Voldemort sculpted his own enemy, by choosing to believe that prophecy he molded you into his enemy. I listened to a lecture on the topic that voiced a similar idea that in order for there to be good in the world there needs to be evil to defeat.‚ÄúImagine, please, just for a moment, that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!‚ÄôHarry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father and Sirius. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat.‚ÄòI‚Äôd want him finished,‚Äô said Harry quietly. ‚ÄòAnd I‚Äôd want to do it.‚Äô‚ÄòOf course you would!‚Äô cried Dumbledore. ‚ÄòYou see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal ‚Ä¶ in other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you ‚Ä¶ which makes it certain, really, that -‚Äò‚ÄòThat one of us is going to end up killing the other,‚Äô said Harry. ‚ÄòYes.‚Äô‚Äù‚Ä¢ The main plot-propelling point is circling around the Pensieve, which at the time of reading I found so fascinating and wondered what memories I would store away. However brilliant the first memory from Bob Ogden, sooner than later these flashbacks start feeling like a contrived set up for a grander plot-device, especially when Dumbledore speaks like he's looking through a crystal ball; Professor Trelawney seems tame in comparison.‚ÄúWhy?‚Äô said Harry at once, looking up into Dumbledore‚Äôs face. ‚ÄòWhy did he come back? Did you ever find out?‚Äô‚ÄòI have ideas,‚Äô said Dumbledore, ‚Äòbut no  than that.‚Äô‚ÄòWhat ideas, sir?‚Äô‚ÄòI shall tell you, Harry, when you have retrieved that memory from Professor Slughorn,‚Äô said Dumbledore. ‚ÄòWhen you have that last piece of the jigsaw, everything will, I hope, be clear ‚Ä¶ to both of us.‚ÄùThis was so defeating to read the first time, being held on a leash with the information that could be released, but on this reread, knowing what's ahead, I could relax and take in all the suspense and foreshadowing.‚Ä¢ It's unfortunate, though, that the author deems all these important adult figures in Harry's life valuable only long enough to serve him in the grand scheme of things. Children need adults to look up to for longer than a semester period. I noticed that even when I was having a good time reading, half-way through a thought would creep in to remind me that half of the characters wouldn‚Äôt survive this series‚Ä¶ and then it felt somehow wrong to laugh at something they said.‚Ä¢Which leads me to discuss the one thing that I dreaded and put-off... I'd forgotten that rereading Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince meant reliving this emotional trauma of a chapter all-over again. I honestly can't believe I got fooled twice into believing that Snape would come to heal Dumbledore. I was utterly and positively assured that when Severus Snape came running down towards Dumbledore it was to cure him of his wounds. My brain somehow managed to repress the memory of that scene and fooled me into believing the same damn thing I thought the very first time... Evidently, the events of this series have all mixed into one for me so that certain scenes from the last book I expect to show up in here. Though nothing prepared me for this line that broke everything:‚ÄòI am not worried, Harry,‚Äô said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. ‚ÄòI am with you.‚ÄôIf nothing else, I'll certainly miss his sage sayings:      ‚ÄòDumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right,‚Äô said Hermione.    I commend the cover illustrator, Jonny Duddle, for taking one of the most painful moments in the book and creating such lively artwork out of it:The illustration on the back cover, in particular, had me staring back and forth to take it all in: the tired eye-bags, the sullen face, the grip on his left arm. SO MUCH DETAIL.And on that chipper note, I'll conclude by saying that taking my time with this reread made the journey so worth it.

Although I could go on and on about this book, there are so many other reviews and reviewers who are likely to have a better one simply because they wrote it write after reading the book or watching the movie. I read it close to ten years ago, saw the movie at least 5 years ago, and though I would love to re-read them... my TBR pile is way too high. That said... it's a fantastic series full of wild imagination, great beauty and intricate sentiment. In this book, Harry must connect with the past and his dark side, trying to figure out who this half-blood prince is... and when he finds out, everything is different. The book is about relationships... discovering things about yourself and others that you didn't know. And when someone Harry absolutely adores is murdered right in front of him, and it's connected with the half-blood prince, it sends Harry on a downward spiral, out of control, but necessary for him to find the inner strength to fight Lord Voldemort. I can't even begin to write a review for this book... let's just go get some coffee or a drink and talk about it. It requires us having an animated conversation... right?About MeFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT.

Rowling created scores of Luna Lovegood fans with hilarious and bizarre commentary from the most unlikely Quidditch commentator.* The effects of Felix Felicis.* We get a fascinating view of the history of Tom Riddle.* The major question of the book: Whose side is Snape really on?Amazon Review:The long-awaited, eagerly anticipated, arguably over-hyped Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince has arrived, and the question on the minds of kids, adults, fans, and skeptics alike is, \"Is it worth the hype?\" The answer, luckily, is simple: yep. A magnificent spectacle  than worth the price of admission, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince will blow you away. However, given that so much has gone into protecting the secrets of the book (including ard trucks and injunctions), don't expect any spoilers in this review. It's much  fun not knowing what's coming--and in the case of Rowling's delicious sixth book, you don't want to know. Just sit tight, despite the earth-shattering revelations that will have your head in your hands as you hope the words will rearrange themselves into a different story. But take one warning to heart: do not open Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince until you have first found a secluded spot, safe from curious eyes, where you can tuck in for a good long read. Because once you start, you won't stop until you reach the very last page. A darker book than any in the series thus far with a level of sophistication belying its genre, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince moves the series into murkier waters and marks the arrival of Rowling onto the adult literary scene. While she has long been praised for her cleverness and wit, the strength of Book 6 lies in her subtle development of key characters, as well as her carefully nuanced depiction of a community at war. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, no one and nothing is safe, including preconceived notions of good and evil and of right and wrong. With each book in her increasingly remarkable series, fans have nervously watched J.K. Rowling raise the stakes; gone are the simple delights of butterbeer and enchanted candy, and days when the worst ailment could be cured by a bite of chocolate. A series that began as a colorful lark full of magic and discovery has become a dark and deadly war zone. But this should not come as a shock to loyal readers. Rowling readied fans with Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix by killing off popular characters and engaging the young students in battle. Still, there is an unexpected bleakness from the start of Book 6 that casts a mean shadow over Quidditch games, silly flirtations, and mountains of homework. Ready or not, the tremendous ending of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince will leave stunned fans wondering what great and terrible events await in Book 7 if this sinister darkness is meant to light the way.",

I have the perfect example to use from this book: when Draco Malfoy tries to use one of the Unforgivable Curses on Harry, at Hogwarts no less, Harry's not the least bit interested to tell anyone, but when he turns a corner, we get to read a entire page about Peeves the Poltergeist throwing chalk at him. . . again. Yes, Harry, make sure and go tell staff that Peeves is throwing chalk at you, but leave off that boring business of the student trying to kill you in the bathroom. Such inconsistencies annoy me.Also, after rereading some 3,350 pages of Harry Potter so far this year, I can't help but wonder. . . how are we to keep suspending our disbelief that the adult wizarding world times their actions to coincide perfectly with the school year at Hogwarts? I mean, how can every evildoer in the wizarding world be inspired to perform their misdeeds right as the school year comes to a close in June? Couldn't she just one time have made some bad shit happen in February? This is a writing habit that has just been way too tidy for me.And yet. . . here I was. . . rereading book 6 aloud to my middle child in our living room as my son was in the background, moving his belongings back into the house for summer when I got to this part:‚ÄúSir, you haven't told us what's in this one,‚Äù said Ernie Macmillan, pointing at a small black cauldron standing on Slughorn's desk. The potion within was splashing about merrily; it was the color of molten gold, and large drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface, though not a particle had spilled.My son stop moving, set down the box that had been in his hands, then came and sat down on the couch and said, ‚ÄúFelix Felicis.‚Äù My daughter and I nodded our heads in approval and Hermione Granger contributed, ‚ÄúIt's liquid luck.‚ÄùNext thing you know, my littlest child poked her head around the corner and revealed that she'd been listening as well. My middle child blew up in anger at her, throwing a pair of dirty socks at her head, but her little sister prevailed and came into the center of the living room and declared as she sat down on the carpet, ‚ÄúI just want to listen to the story.‚ÄùImagine me now, feeling the bliss, reading my favorite Harry Potter book to all three of my kids at once, in the center of my living room, on a beautiful spring day. And that right there is the magic, folks. It's not that I'm the world's most engaging narrator. It's not that J.K. Rowling writes novels like Graham Greene. J.K. Rowling's magic is in her storytelling.Storytelling is not writing, and not all writers are storytellers, but good writing that contains excellent storytelling takes the reading experience to the sublime.We clambered to the climax of this story together and now we are poised to take on the last novel together, next week. When I asked my middle child how many stars out of five for this one, she answered: ONE THOUSAND.So, ONE THOUSAND stars out of five.",

Well plotted twist from J K -which won't stop twisting the plot cleverly specially in Snape's character- Also there's a depth in Draco's character that really serve the plot of this and next book.Then the guardian role of Dumbledore at Harry's life start to manifest at that book. Then the atmosphere of the life in the wizardry world -like the Diagon ally scene was darker than ever. And there's also the romance which is increase at that part due to the coming of age.

And while this series lacks a lot in many aspects, it does have a bunch of wildly interesting characters. Dumbledore and Snape are definitely among them.

I was nervous to read it again because as it was my favourite the first time I read the series, I was anxious to see if maybe I would be let down. I completely understand why this was my favourite of the series, and still so far is. I connect the most with the characters and the feelings that they are faced with throughout this book. I am bawling my eyes out as I write this review, and with good reason. The death of Dumbledore is earth shattering, and the grave nature of this situation is delivered perfectly. This book is the darkest, I believe, of the series, as Voldemort's reign begins to take place. The fear, and frustration is eminent throughout every word; however, there is lightheartedness throughout. Delving into Voldemort's past is one of the unique aspects portrayed in this book. It's incredibly fascinating to learn the history of the darkest wizard of all time. There is so much we learn, and so much  we can guess about him, which is the sign of a great writer. J.K. Rowling allows the reader to figure things out on their own and take their own ideas from what she gives. It is impossible to lose interest as you discover  and  of this story. However, the biggest and most prominent reason of why this book speaks to me so deeply is because of Draco Malfoy. This is his story, his book, no matter how many ways one can look at it. He is so complex, very smart, troubled, hurt, confused, misunderstood, but nevertheless, strong in his beliefs. He loves his family and will do anything to protect them. Something that I didn't notice the first time I read the books, which I can see now, is that Draco is skilled at hiding his thoughts from intruders, which means that he is skilled in Occlumency. I adore him and it's crazy how one can learn so many things about their favourite character that they didn't know before just by paying attention to detail. This chills me to my core. I connect with him on so many levels, and although this is odd to many people, because they see him as a villain, he is not, and I truly respect him with everything I have. He knows love, perhaps  than even Harry, as he is willing to do what it takes to protect his family. He deserves a chance, just like so many others, as there are many layers to his character. There is so much that I can say about him, but I will keep it at that. I will always cherish this story with all my might. This book destroys me in the best possible ways.",

It may be my favourite so far, in fact yes I believe it is, even though the emotions are so real right now. (I know I said Order was my favourite so far, but this one has overtaken it)I once again, loved every minute of reading this. It was perfect, and also had me lol'ing throughout the whole thing..eh, mostly. not the end.ÔªøThe school and classes scenes were also amazing, that's weirdly one of the things I love most about these books. Hogwarts just being Hogwarts. If I'm being honest, weirdly again, the Quidditch scenes sometimes Ôªøbecome a little tedious to me sometimes, but I even loved those in this book, they were just so funny. Thankyou Liquid Luck. (ÔªøÔªøthat was amazing, hahaha) The Apparition lessons were also a great laugh!J.K. Rowling is brilliant in everything she does; the humour, suspense, mystery... I mean, she even had me guessing and confused even though I've seen the movies a billion times.I loved getting to delve deeper into the motives and life of Voldemort, it was just so interesting to learn about his past, and what makes him such a complex character. As well as seeing the relationships, or lack of, with him and other people.The love aspect of this book, oh the loveeee, was so cute to read about. I mean, between Ron and Hermione, and Harry and Ginny, how could it not be good? You could really see them growing up throughout this novel, which I also enjoyed.The relationship between Harry and Dumbledore grew even  in this book (which made the ending that much harder) I've always loved reading about the dynamic between those two. Such a bond.Malfoy, well he was such an interesting character in this one, right from the moment when he stepped on Harry's nose *wince*, that was intense. It was so cool to be able to read about the mystery behind this guy, and try to figure him out a bit . Draco has always fascinated me, which is probably half to do with Tom Felton, let's be real.Snape, uhm, I'm still kinda confused where I stand in regards to if I like or don't like him, at the moment it's a bit of both. I guess the Deathly Hallows will help me out, but I do really enjoy reading about Snape, even if he makes some...questionable decisions.Can't forget to mention Slughorn! He was a great addition to the story, I really enjoyed his character, and all that he brought to the novel.Once again, the friendship between Ron/Harry/Hermione warmed my little heart, and also tore at it a bit over the course of the novel *cough* thanks Lavender *cough*. But they never fail to make me smile. I feel like even though there was still a bit of it, the angst levels were much lower in this one, haha.Also, how can you not love Fred and George? I adore those two, they're like me in twin boy form. All-in-All, this was yet another solid addition to this amazing series, and it's just incredible how much  I'm getting out of the books than the movies, I really didn't expect to learn this much. Admittedly, I didn't even truly know what a Horcrux was until this book...oops.Can't believe it's time for the final journey...",

Because I can only think of very few things that matter.I think I would've liked  povs other than Harry's, I don't hate him but at this point I think I've seen most of him and not enough of the others. I even had enough of Ron and Hermione and didn't enjoy them in this, they kept bickering since book 3 and it's getting tiresome now.I did really like Dumbeldor and Harry's sessions together, I liked Slughorn and Snape and Voldemort's past stories. --------------------------------------Buddy read with Witch One? and Witch Too",

        "School is out for the summer! The last day of school is usually a bittersweet occasion as I look back and see my kids growing up right before my eyes. With the year winding down on top of everything else in the world right now, I found myself overwhelmed and at a loss for what to read next. Then I remembered that in Retro Chapter Chicks we are reading Harry Potter this year, each at our own pace. For better or for worse, Harry and his magical world has been a part of my reading for my entire aduSchool is out for the summer! The last day of school is usually a bittersweet occasion as I look back and see my kids growing up right before my eyes. With the year winding down on top of everything else in the world right now, I found myself overwhelmed and at a loss for what to read next. Then I remembered that in Retro Chapter Chicks we are reading Harry Potter this year, each at our own pace. For better or for worse, Harry and his magical world has been a part of my reading for my entire adult life. When I find myself entering a reading rut or when life gets busy, Harry has been there to offer an escape. An escape into magic is exactly what I needed even with the series growing darker as it nears its completion. Yet, Harry‚Äôs problems are not my own, so I return to Hogwarts to get away from the grim realities of life. Harry Potter has turned sixteen and about to enter the sixth year of his magical education. After battling Death Eaters at the Ministry of Magic, the Ministry believes Dumbledore once again and order has been restored in the magical world, at least on the surface. Harry is now ‚Äúthe chosen one,‚Äù the one destined to defeat Voldemort once and for all, and the magical world has put its faith in Harry that he can carry the day. That is quite a burden to handle for a sixteen year old who is left without a family once again, his beloved g-dfather Sirius falling in the battle at the ministry. Harry is still in school as well, beginning advanced magical study in his quest to become an auror and having been named Quidditch captain to boot. Dumbledore has told Harry to rely on his two closest friends to get through the task at hand, yet even that is a tall order with teenaged hormones raging at Hogwarts. Defeating Voldemort is as paramount as ever, so Dumbledore takes it upon himself to further Harry‚Äôs education and give him the tools to win the battle once and for all. I have always viewed the Half Blood Prince as the call before the storm. Fred and George‚Äôs joke shop is standing room only as all wizards look to get a few laughs to escape the grim realities of their own life. Before stepping foot in the joke shop, Harry assists Dumbledore in persuading Professor Horace Slughorn to come out of retirement to teach potions. Slughorn has the ability to transfigure into a sofa and has a penchant for candied pineapple and mulled mead, which he collects from his prized former pupils, known as The Slug Club. One of these students was none other than Harry‚Äôs mother Lily Evans, the best potioneer that Slughorn has taught. Harry is primed to be the star attraction of Slughorn‚Äôs new Slug Club; despite once being head of Slytherin house and a favorite professor of many current death eaters, Slughorn begrudgingly agrees to return to Hogwarts. His presence lightens the mood in the castle immensely, as Rowling focuses on his lessons at the expense of most others, even though other subjects are equally important. Slughorn introduces his students to love potions, legal brewing of the poly juice potion, and the golden Felix Felicis, a potion that will give the drinker good luck for an entire day. With Slughorn teaching potions instead of Snape, Harry excels in the subject for the first time in his life, propelling him toward his career as an auror. Love plays a large role here, Voldemort overlooking it‚Äôs importance and students as well as peripheral characters enjoying varying degrees of romance. Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour are engaged to be married, much to chagrin of all the Weasleys. Ron and Hermoine‚Äôs feelings for each change daily; knowing how things end up, it is both comical and frustrating to witness how both of them date other people just to aggravate each other. And knowing how things end up, I still much prefer Hermoine and Crumb and Ron with perhaps someone who has not been introduced yet. From book one it was obvious that Ginny and Harry would end up together, and this story arc is in full effect here. Harry, however, does not have much time to act on his feelings as he is too busy trying to save the world. Ginny notes that that is what she loves about him although additional tender moments would have furthered the storyline. The volatile nature of teenaged love shows that nothing is set in stone, setting the stage for a grand finish later. In addition to the love and learning, Dumbledore takes Harry on a trip down pensieve memory lane to try to find out as much about Voldemort as possible prior to doing battle. Other than the memories, Voldemort does not make an appearance in the book. He is biding his time, waiting for Dumbledore‚Äôs army to make the first move. Rowling would rather treat her readers to teenage life - dating, studying for NEWTs, apparition lessons, quidditch- than the impending fight against evil. Careful readers know that Voldemort is the heir of Slytherin, and we meet his mother, uncle, and grandfather here. They indeed place importance on the purity of blood and hold true to Slytherin‚Äôs heirlooms; Voldemort himself inherited the penchant to place the upmost importance on trophies linking him to the past. Being raised in an orphanage, he lost the ability to love at a young age and entered Hogwarts a broken person. Although he and Harry both view Hogwarts as their true home after growing up without parents, it is there were their paths diverge, as Dumbledore has reminded Harry that choices are  valued than abilities. Harry with the unlimited propensity to love all creatures is on display here to the point where he even feels sorry for a youthful Lord Voldemort. It is love which carries this book that Voldemort has overlooked in his quest toward wizard world domination. It is the same love that Harry and his friends will undoubtedly use to defeat the dark lord. Series changing revelations occur as the book draws to an end, both whose repercussions will be felt in the series‚Äô final installment. Harry Potter provided me with an escape once again. Even though I knew what was coming, I could not resist the urge to read the last four hundred pages in one long day of reading. For me nothing replaces the feeling of immersing myself in a book rather than taking the time to savor it. I have my summer reading list planned out in earnest and it includes one last trip to Harry‚Äôs magical world. For the few days I spend reading it, Harry will provide me with a respite relief from the world around me, which is the best I can ask of from a book. 5 + stars all time favorite ‚ú®üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüîÆüßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ú®",

To say I wasn‚Äôt ready would be an understatement.Where do I begin? I‚Äôm really starting to enjoy the dark turn that this series is taking, especially since The Order of the Phoenix. The entertainment factor is definitely increasing for me now that we‚Äôre receiving  information on Voldemort‚Äôs past life. While the first couple of books seemed to have their own individual storylines, now that Voldemort is being explored often the plot feels  continuous, as this will surely be important for the rest of the series.I take back everything I said in previous reviews abut Draco growing  malicious each book. This instalment really made me feel for him, especially after discovering the motive behind his actions. He‚Äôs still a teenager, and it‚Äôs awful what he‚Äôs forced to endure.I find as the cast of characters matures and grows older, I can relate to them  and find a better connectivity to the story. This is perhaps why I‚Äôve enjoyed the later books in this series significantly , as Harry and his friends are further from children. Harry‚Äôs emotions are becoming  complex as he ages, which has allowed me to sympathize with him  easily. The romance has definitely become  prominent in this book, though I will admit I don‚Äôt care much for any of the canon pairings. (Wolfstar is the only couple I could have cared for if it happened). This being said I don‚Äôt disagree with any of the ships, either. I‚Äôm definitely  invested in the plot itself which leaves me with little to care for in terms of the characters‚Äô love lives.‚ÄúIt is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing .‚ÄùThe Half Blood Prince was a great penultimate book; I‚Äôm really looking forward to the series conclusion! JK Rowling better do her best and deliver a finale worth the while.",

So instead of throwing away or burning the pages( which is so harsh punishment because this book is still a classic and it‚Äôs one of the best ones of the series)freezing the book and never forgiving the author for killing one of my favorite characters were the best choices I‚Äôve had.As my new weekend quarantine habit: I started retro weekend tradition and reread my favorite series. Even though this book broke my heart  than a decade before, at least this time I prepared myself with lots of tissues and golden toilet papers( they‚Äôre so precious things and I hang them on the walls with hand sanitizers as if they‚Äôre historical artifacts.) and I bottled up my happy memories inside my head to protect my heart tear apart.  This is sweet 16 adventures of Harry: the girl crushes, secret smiles, hormonal and characteristic changes, seeing the world from different aspect! If I didn‚Äôt get so sad with the unexpected ending, this might be second favorite HP book because JKR- wizard of the words reflected the emotional and psychical changing as they grow up  and realize the biggest danger out there to steal their best times of their lives.I never get bored to reread any HP books or anything JKR writes. (instead of shopping list. Lately they made me sleep!)

I will not even really write a proper review, because who doesn't know this book at this point? I will, however, tell you exactly why this is my favorite book of the series. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Dumbledore finally decides that it is time to teach Harry everything he knows about Voldemort so that Harry can eventually defeat him. But Dumbledore knows Harry well, and he knows his faults and weaknesses. Enter Harry's two best friends, Ron and Hermione. You guys, this book is about the power of friendship. Tom Riddle has always worked alone, friendless and self-sufficient. He trusts no one and has no sense of obligation, even to his loyal followers. They are disposable. He has no one to tell him that his ideas suck, or that he is going about things the wrong way, or that his ideas really really suck, and he wouldn't listen to them if he did. In contrast, since Dumbledore understands that Harry's faults and weakness are made up for by his two friends, he encourages Harry to share everything he learns with them. Hermione is exceptionally brilliant and cautious, while Ron is brave and has tons of practical common sense. Hermione and Ron help balance out Harry's often reckless, undisciplined, how-I-feel-at-this-moment-is-all-that-matters brain. They have learned to rely on each other and listen even if they don't always agree. This has created a very strong bond of fierce loyalty, responsibility, and obligation. Even Ron and Hermione's constant skepticism of Harry's ideas throughout this book is an indication of how great this friendship is. As seen in books 1-5, Harry's ideas are sometimes right and sometimes horribly, horribly wrong. These friends don't take \"the chosen one\" at his word. They challenge him and question him. They aren't just along for the ride. They are in it to freaking win it. Together.But how difficult is it when, in a group of 3, person 1 and 2 start falling for each other and person 3 starts falling for the sister of person 1? Ugh, teenage hormones. The friendship and support Harry has always had through all the terrible things and difficult tasks are suddenly at risk. Watching them work this out is cringe-worthy but oh so true.As the book progresses, it becomes increasingly apparent that defeating Voldemort will be an exceptionally difficult task. However, it has been emphasized over and over again throughout the entire series that it will take teamwork to rid the world of evil. In The Sorcerer's Stone, none of the 3 by themselves could have made it through each of the tasks leading up to finding the stone. In The Chamber of Secrets, each of them again played an important role in destroying the first horcrux (which didn't die easily, by the way), along with the crucial assistance of a phoenix and a hat. In The Prisoner of Azkaban, what in the world would have happened if any of the 3 had not taken part? In The Goblet of Fire, Harry would have never gotten through the tournament if the others hadn't help him learn the necessary skills. In The Order of the Phoenix, Harry would have died for sure in the Dept of Mysteries without the D.A. And in this book, we find that Dumbledore himself acted rashly with the second horcrux (which also didn't die easily, by the way), and that this man, perhaps the greatest wizard who ever lived, couldn't have retrieved horcrux #3 without a second person being there to help. When Harry realizes what he has to do at the end of the book, Ron and Hermione quickly, calmly, and unselfishly insist that they will leave their families and their education and go with him whether he likes it or not. Harry sets out on this nearly impossible task with no army except his two soulmates, which might give him a fighting chance against a man with an army of evil but no soul.",

Have you already read‚Ä¶you have?‚ÄùPause.(view spoiler)[‚ÄúDUMBLEDORE DIES?!‚Äù (hide spoiler)]And that, dear friends, is how I came to know the climactic event of this legendary tome a week before it arrived at my house, and my reaction, and that of other nearby colleagues, can be best summed up by three words that rhyme with ‚Äúdruther plucking brass pole.‚ÄùThat notwithstanding, this remains a poignantly affecting chapter in the saga, one that‚Äôs hard to read without simultaneously mourning the fallen and lamenting the lost innocence of characters we‚Äôve watched grow so much. Still, could have used  Fred and George. Then again, so can everything. Except maybe my wedding night. Well, no, even that would have been enhanced by them.",

Like, a LOT. Also Snape can go die in the dumpster where he belongs.19/10/2017What I said about Snape last time stands. He. Is. The. Worst. That...pretty much sums up my thoughts at the moment. 21/12/2016God, I hate Snape. He really is the worst teacher on the planet. \"I want you to perform a non-verbal spell, which you've never done before and I'm going to give you no instructions about how to do that. Go. (Points will be deducted from every house that isn't Slytherin just because I'm a vindictive asshat)\"29/12/2015Alternate title: \"Harry Potter and the Year Shit Got Real\". We get so much backstory on Voldemort here, but it's also a year of Harry dealing with incredibly adult concepts and events. He's not only freaking out about school and fighting Voldemort, he's dealing with disappointing his teachers, and having feelings for Ginny, and his best friends CLEARLY having feelings for each other but not being prepared to act on them yet. So he's trapped in a series of incredibly awkward situations while also learning about magic that's way above his current level of understanding. And basically, I just want to hug all of the characters. Except Snape. He can go die in a fire. 23/6/2014Like I said last time around, this is the book where Ginny comes into her own. It's also a book that's a lot  about Malfoy than it is about Harry. I mean, obviously it's told from Harry's perspective so it's still his story. But on rereads, it becomes apparent that Draco is on Struggle Street for the duration of this book. He's shoved into a situation he doesn't want to be in, he's pale and not sleeping, he's ignored by his teachers and constantly reprimanded by his head of house, and he has to resort to Moaning Myrtle for sympathy. In comparison, Harry's year is a walk in the park. ANYWAY. As is always the case, I found new things this time around, but this time the new thing was rather profound: \"Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realise that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different!\" (Dumbledore to Harry, p. 477) Excuse me while I go and think serious thoughts.2/1/2013I love this book. Like, so much. The ending kills me EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. There's so much backstory, so much explanation of WHY Voldemort is the way he is. I must confess, I DO love Deathly Hallows just that little bit , but I think that's because of the sense of closure we get. This, however, is the book that makes me wish Ginny had been  prevalent in Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire, and Order of the Phoenix. Because Ginny is freaking AWESOME. She's a total badass, and it sucks that her character spends so much of the series languishing in the background because Harry's too much of a dipshit to notice that she's there. I can understand why some people don't like it - there's a lot of detail, and all the action is crammed into the last fifty or so pages. But at the end of the day, this book serves as a set up to the big finale in Deathly Hallows. And it does so admirably.",

Even though he is evil, you can‚Äôt deny that he is a mastermind. The romance was entertaining and comedic which was a good thing since it put all the seriousness on hold for awhile. It‚Äôs incredible seeing how much darker the books and films get since Philosopher‚Äôs Stone. I thoroughly enjoyed each minute I spent reading this novel and in no way did I feel as if it was dragged out. Every single chapter was essential to the whole Wizarding World. The characters become much  complex in the Half Blood Prince and J.K. Rowling does an outstanding job in developing them. This was such a detailed novel that I will have to revisit once I start the whole series over. ",

Few of the previous Defence Against the Dark Arts teachers has survived their full year of teaching!There are teenage romances at Hogwarts and the usual sorting out of emotional turmoil associated with mid adolescenceHarry Potter's feelings for Ron's lovely flame haired sister Ginny is growing, and Ron himself is dating Lavender Brown (somewhat 'air headed' and silly but I've always has a soft spot for Lavender) which causes tension between Ron and Hermione.Harry shows his admirable and strong character in small ways as well as ones of greater portent.On the train to Hogwarts, Harry is in a carriage with the awkward Neville Longbottom and the eccentric Luna Lovegood and Romilda Vane asks Harry to join her and her her friends in her carriage, adding \"You don't have to sit with them'. Harry tells her in no uncertain terms that 'They're friends of mine'It is the small acts of heroism as well as the momentous ones that define Harry Potter.There are several center pieces of the bulk of the book is the journey Professor Dumbeldoreguides Harry on, on the history of the life of Voldermort, formerly Tom RiddleWhile it is difficult to sympathize with the thoroughly evil Voldmort, who shows a penchant for murder from the beginning, I certainly felt sad for his mother Merope Gaunt, brutally ill treated by her father and brother, and abandoned by her muggle husband, dying hours after giving birth to Tom (the future Voldemort).Also Harry Potter comes into ownership on a book on potions that was once owned by a mysterious 'half blood prince' which gives his powerful and vast knowledge, invaluable to his magical education and growth of his powers.Meanwhile a series of evil attacks in which Katie Bell is seriously hurt by a mysterious necklace and Ron is poisoned occur, and all signs point to Draco Malfoy, who Harry has reason to believe has joined Voldemorts's followers as a death eater.The wisdom of Dubledore lead to some wry wisdom from him, which add to the subtle philosophical element of the series.But it is the earth shattering climax that will really enthrall and shock you, I am lucky enough to have the final book in the series on hand having just read this one and it's predecessor and can only imagine the frustration of Potter fans having to wait two years for the Deathly Hallows after the events of this blockbuster leave you wondering what the finale will bring.",

I just think Luna deserved  page space than she got in this book. - Where was Slughorn when everybody else was fighting the death eaters? - I read reviews that said that Dumbledore should have just poured the poison on the ground instead of drinking it, but judging by it I think it would have just refilled itself. However, that is my speculation, and it would have been nicer to see it have actually said something about that in the book to close that loop-hole. - I adored Fleur's reaction to Bill's injuries. It was amazing and brought tears to my eyes. To see that she was actually scared that he might not love her after this, but never waiving in her love for him. - I am sure this has been said million times, but, book's Ginny is simply fantastic! Ginny grew up with Fred and George, so of course she turned out to be brave, daring and fiery (I only wish the movie could have displayed it properly...) She adds a nice touch, and it is only proper to give Harry, who is a teenager, a love interest. Otherwise it would have been unrealistic, really, for almost all of us meet our first love in school. - I was getting really bored of them doing their homework, getting to classes, doing homework, walking to classes, thinking of classes... You get the drill. I just feel like if I was Harry, and I knew that the fate of my friend's and the world in whole, is basically in my hands, I wouldn't worry so much about doing homework. No normal teenager would. Draco actually was the only one who was acting sensible in this case, saying that O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s won't matter any. - It was hard to see Ron being a bully and a prat, but I think his behavior was completely normal for a teenager, who have never been kissed and just got bullied by his little sister about it. I think Rowling portrayed raging teenager emotions very well in these last two books. - As sad as it was I appreciated Harry panicking at the lake and losing his head. It showed him as a regular and ordinary person once , to prove a point that we all make mistakes, and that nobody is a super hero.My WEBSITEMy INSTAGRAMMy WORDPRESS BLOG",

Some would say the series had to end at some point and that the killings were not so bold. Ah, but many a publishing and movie executive would disagree and cry out, \"Why?!

It's that semi-awkward stage book where it's going to lead to the last big-bang fight and wrap-up, has to introduce new stuff for the story but play on the old without wrapping that up just yet.Harry has lost his mope from Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, feeling accepted again amongst his peers and not left out in the dark any longer, but he retains the natural anger and fear that he should have in his circumstance. There's some mini developments between him and a female character romantically wise, which to me fits the series well. Hermione and Ron also are leaning toward each other , even if they haven't made it officially official just yet.If you're a fan of Dumbledore, this book will both please and infuriate you. He's in  scenes than ever while he gives Harry private lessons, showing both his and other people's memories, all leading to a fascinating backstory focusing on Voldemort. You don't actually get to see the monstrous villain in this book - you only hear about him, which is typical of the earlier installments. There's a few death eaters popping up though, including Fenrir, a new big-bad I hadn't noticed before, a demented werewolf of all things. Can I just say this guy is actually creepy? Especially his focus on hurting and turning children.As always these books are impossible to put down, since Rowling's writing technique not only rocks, but she gives us unique characters who are individuals standing out from each other while working toward standing together unified. Rowling always introduces a new stand-out character in books; here it's a new potions master who enjoys fame and getting to know students who he has determined are 'going places.' Dumbledore has something else up his sleeve about this teacher, too...Pacing wise it's okay, as this book is  of a filler than anything, but it does give us one big revelation concerning Voldemort. All the other books pointed toward this, but it's now  obvious coming together when Harry sees the larger picture. While a stepping stone to the next book, 'The Half-Blood Prince' is in no way boring. You get to see Harry with his friends and relationships, a little in the classes and especially wondering who on earth the Half-Blood prince is. That mystery intrigued me since I couldn't figure it out for awhile, and I'd forgotten since watching the movie years back.While the new potions teacher is introduced, Snape finally gets his turn at 'Defense against the Dark Arts.' I was slightly bummed we didn't get to see  time spent in his class, however. I've always enjoyed the classroom teaching and experiences in the other books, and here was a chance to see freaking SNAPE of all people talking about the dark arts! Unfortunately there's just the one classroom moment. Although we don't see too much on the teaching side, Snape is still brilliantly constructed and a page-stealer when he comes on scene.As with the previous book, there's a heartbreaking ending to this one, so have the tissues handy.I'll keep them handy when I go on to the next and last book, where I know  depressing stuff will happen. And of course I'll need tissues just knowing it's the last book and that it's time to get off this ride. :(",

The thing is, I'm obsessed with Harry Potter, no way around it. I've been obsessed, and  than likely will always be obsessed. So I can't really step back and give a biased review on this book... but I will give a review nonetheless.This book did not let me down. Just like Order of the Phoenix I read it within 24 hours. Every single chapter, sentence, word, grabbed at me! By this point in the series I'm seriously invested in the characters and the events going on around them, and Rowling has not done anything to them to upset me too much. Well, there is something that happens to one of my favorite characters at the end of the book, but I'm not going to spoil it because there are actually still people out there who have yet to read the book.The thing that is amazing about Rowling is that as Harry grows, her writing seems to grow as well. If you look back at the first book and compare it to the sixth book, the first book seems so childish, young, easy and simple, while the sixth book is the exact opposite. It also makes the books a lot  accessible to readers of all ages. Kids can start reading them on their own or with their parents, and adults can read them and reassure themselvest that they're not reading a kids book.There's so much I want to say about this book and this series, but... I can't without giving too much away. If you haven't read the series, you will be very lost if you start with this book, so start at the beginning. If you have read the series but haven't read this one yet, get it now and read it! It will not disappoint you at all! Once again, Rowling has out done herself. Now... we just wait for the seventh book.",

Ginny is amazing. üßôüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èThe tension between Ron and Hermoine: I love how they both refuse to recognize their feelings because this is so true to how best friends feel when they are falling for each other. They don't want to admit it because it might ruin the friendship so then they just self-distruct and make stupid choices. I love how Rowling writes this so much because it reminds us that even with everything going on they really are just teenagers. üßôüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Dumbledore: He is wise. He is courageous and he is hilarious. üßôüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Argog's Funeral: I believe I have said this before about Hagrid's character, but I absolutely love how we get to see his love of the creatures in each book. This loss is just another reminder of his deep love and empathy, and also reminds us of how great a relationship Harry has with Hagrid. üßôüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Draco: I love to hate him so much. His secrecy and then his grand plan revealed and foiled. I love that even though he is so deep in the dark arts he is still at war with himself about what he really wants to be. It's such a great teaser for what is to come. J.K. Rowling has created a world woven together by deep connections, complex chraracter arcs and gorgeous writing. This book is a perfect representation of that truth.",

The identity of the Half-blood prince is revealed at the end and provides a nifty twist. We are also strung along with the question of whether Snape is or isn‚Äôt working for the dark side. Is Dumbledore really gone, or has he found a way to preserve a portion of his soul by arranging his own death? There are talismans that are left unanalyzed that will no doubt provide the roots of the final book. It was a very enjoyable ride in the classic series of our time.A small pet peeve is that I think poor Ron deserves better than to be the ever-present comic relief.",

This book, well, this is the book that completely broke me.I know I've gone on and on in my previous posts about the characters in this book, so I'm just going to say, I still love them all. Actually, I love them even  after reading this book, if that's even possible. Harry, Ron and Hermione have a friendship that everyone wants, but most people rarely have, and I've loved watching this bond grow  and  as the series has gone along. I have so many favorite characters in this series, and this post would be  like a novel if I went on and on about them. I just love them all.As I mentioned above, this is the book in the series that completely broke me. I knew what was coming near the end, as it is super hard to avoid spoilers for a book that has been out so long, but while I knew the main events, I did not know the details, and that's what really got me. I was an absolute complete blubbering mess from chapter 27 on to the end of the book. While I have cried at the previous books in the series, this one was super ugly crying. That ending, it just broke my heart. Sigh.Overall; even though this book broke my heart into so many pieces, I still adored so many things about Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, and I'm so glad to have finally read it.

Of course, constructing the finale around such a simple and direct concept for the ending of the conflict is easy for the author. However, it is formulaic and predictable for the reader, and robs us of actually seeing a physical and intellectual struggle between foes. Of course, this does not mean that they do not strive against one another, but by providing the separation of such a plot device, relocates the entire point-of-conflict to an arbitrary, external point. Thermal exhaust port, indeed.For  on such plot-specific concepts, please enjoy this article:  book was mainly built to set up the finale, and feels in many ways to be less of a complete story than a 'second in a trilogy', without a real point and ending of its own, and reliant on the final chapter to decide its importance. This is also the book with the greatest adherence to actually surprising the audience with a main character death. At least, it would be, if it weren't unfortunately easy to match the emotional directives given to the characters by the author and recognize that what the author wants us to think shows us precisely what will happen. Misdirection is an art, but it should not have to be a martial one.Long story short, I unfortunately guessed the 'twist' and spent the greater part of this book watching the author try to throw red herrings in my path. A bit disappointing, but still a fairly interesting and exciting tale. The historical and character exploration provide some of the strongest elements in any of her books. It does not quite reach the heights in tone, emotion, or motivation of the last book, but she never does reach that height again.My Fantasy Book Suggestions",

I never actually read book 5 (Order of the Phoenix) so why not just start from the beginning and binge read the whole sha-bang? Honest to goodness, it was totally worth it. I'm annoyed at my younger self for not reading the series like it was meant to be read, but who cares? I'm an adult now and adulting is hard, so we reward ourselves with Harry Potter. I read Order of the Phoenix in 2017 as well, so it has been a fair bit of time since I've bothered with the boy wizard and his merrily troop of misfits. Lucky for me, I've watched the movies god knows how many times so I have a good idea of what happened last time around. My positives:1. Ginny, Neville and Luna by far stand out in this book. I love their rebellion, quirkiness and overall levels of fun. They are obviously different character types, but they stand out as a strong supporting cast. Malfoy took a bit of a back seat in this one for me, but these guys were fun! I loved them. Sometimes I feel like I am Luna...2. I used to hate the long narratives when I initially read these books, but now I love it. I love going into the lore and picking apart the different storylines and webs J.K. was trying to make. The Half Blood Prince lore, Voldemort/Tom Riddle's history, and Slughorn... it's all so cool. It's one of the reasons I love FNAF so much - there's so much lore hidden and woven that the story is just SO DARN COOL. To top it off, these lore bits don't slow the pace down at all. It's truly amazing. This woman is TALENTED. And to grow the characters with the age groups who would be reading? SO COOL. SO SO COOL. Am I the only one who wants to see the crazy map J.K. made to set this story up? 3. Snarky comments towards Snape. Seriously, I wish I had the courage to act like that back in my youthful years at elementary/high school. 4. This book is much darker than the other books and... I dig it. I didn't back in the day (2017-era, you know... a LONG time ago...) but I like it now. Maybe because I'm older and wiser and adult life is dark sometimes? Who knows.5. The curse of the Defense Against the Dark Arts job. That should have been stressed WAY  in the movies, because it's super cool. I'm using the word cool a lot... oh well. It's cool!6. This has nothing to do with the book, but Bill is Domhnall Gleeson and man that Irish boy is wonderful. Ten points to Gryffindor. 7. The comedy is spot on in this book despite it being a dark mess. Ron's nicknames, the love potions, the snarky comments (which I listed above but totally fits here too) - all of it really makes for a well rounded book. My negatives:1. I have always love book Hermione way  than movie Hermione. I've researched the heck out of why they made the characters the way they did in the movie (Ron is super dumb in the movies, Rupert Grint deserved way better than THAT) but that doesn't change the fact that the books do the characters justice. She's not as annoying in books 1-5, but is starting to get a little annoying... the whole romance thing is not J.K.'s specialty (I think almost everyone can agree on that point). I wish they would have had Harry and Hermione grow closer, because their character types seems much better together than Ron and Hermione. But that's just me.2. I never understood why Dumbledore had to drink out of the gauntlet. I still don't, to be brutally honest. There's probably some explanation somewhere and I could look it up... but let's be honest, I won't remember to.3. The death didn't hit me as hard this time, but probably because I knew it was coming. I was very much heart broken when my 10 year old self picked up The Deathly Hallows without reading The Half Blood Prince (judge me, please... I read the last chapter first. I made big mistakes in my childhood, I'll own up to them) and found out about the death. 4. I want  information on the new Minister of Magic. I felt like he could have been utilized . He kind of just seemed like a plot device. He's super seedy and totally worth going into... but I know book seven won't be focusing on him.5. I couldn't be bothered with the Quidditch match in this book. I honestly just didn't care about it any. GIVE ME LORE AND DRAMA GOSHDARNIT J.K.!Overall, this book is an absolute gem and I'm pumped to re-read this series. It's a book that when I picked it up, I know I'm going to enjoy it and find something new and exciting in it. I'm amazed that it holds up so well (maybe not perfectly, but almost spot on) and that I can still enjoy it as an adult. That's a true testament.Here's my prediction, in three to five years I will probably pick it up again. If you've been avoiding this book or just haven't picked it up, you should do it. Just watching how the books change in tone over the years (imagine a ten year old picking up the first book and grow as the years pass on) is cool all on it's own. Will I read the eighth book? Probably. It's going to take a few years to get my hands on The Cursed Child but I AM READY.Five out of five stars. This girl needed a book to pull her back into her love of reading after a couple very, very bad weeks, AND IT WORKED.Now, any recommendations for  books that are as awesome as this? HIT ME UP.",

        "Issues:1. Harry doesn‚Äôt have to be the greatest wizard of his time but that he peaked in third year with mastering the patronus charm is quite sad. It‚Äôs also sad that he doesn‚Äôt feel he needs to work at magic. The idea that Harry could have been in Slytherin or Ravenclaw is laughable - he has no drive, and no intellectual curiosity.

Harry doesn‚Äôt have to be the greatest wizard of his time but that he peaked in third year with mastering the patronus charm is quite sad. It‚Äôs also sad that he doesn‚Äôt feel he needs to work at magic. The idea that Harry could have been in Slytherin or Ravenclaw is laughable - he has no drive, and no intellectual curiosity. Draco grasped occulumency in two months in order to guard himself against Snape, an ally. Harry won't do it to protect himself against Voldemort, even though having failed to do so resulted in Sirius' death. Harry doesn't try even when new skills are obviously useful - not with occulmency, not with wordless magic. Harry turns out to be good at a few discrete things - the patronus charm, resisting the imperius curse - but that never extends, kind of like how Ron's chess skills never extend to any type of application in real life.2. I'm not opposed to Sirius' death but I am opposed to how it means nothing in this book. Harry reassesses nothing. Again, we see Draco taking his responsibilities seriously, Draco questioning authority and learning independence, while Harry continues to prioritize quidditch and his chest monster, and follows whatever Dumbledore says even though he knows Dumbledore is keeping things from him once again. (It also is a little annoying that everyone keeps on saying that one should trust Dumbledore's judgment of Snape; Dumbledore didn't realize that a Death Eater was impersonating one of his close friends for a year). It's a little disgusting that the big reveal with Tonks is that she couldn't care less about Sirius; she's upset that Lupin won't marry her. Not a soul cares about Sirius. Mrs. Weasley doesn't even think to speak of Sirius' death when she sees Harry. Given what happens/doesn't happen with Remus as well (he doesn't form any type of familial bond with Harry, has a totally out of the blue romance plot, reveals himself to be a coward, then dies), I think JKR dislikes the idea of messy, non-blood related, non-nuclear families and finds it easier to dispose of these characters, leaving the core characters to marry into the 'real' family (Weasleys). Sirius had to die, and Remus had to fail to step up, so that Harry would be left with neatly marrying into the Weasleys. I feel confident in this view having seen JKR say that Lupin had to die because she decided to let Arthur Weasley (a total nonentity who has no value other than being part of the Weasleys) live. It's easier to kill off these survivors and imagine them all smiling down on Harry in the afterlife than to imagine that they could ever have a place in society.3. Harry/Tom Riddle parallels were unceremoniously dumped. Instead of going with what she already had developed, JKR chose to make TMR a born inbred sociopath with a ‚Äúbestial‚Äù expression who at age 11 says things like ‚ÄúI can make them hurt if I want to.‚Äù JKR has also said in an interview that TMR couldn‚Äôt feel love because he was born of rape. Why develop the parallels / choices vs abilities theme only to abandon it? And though I understand what she was doing with the pureblood-inbred insanity thing, frankly, no one wants to read that degeneration shit. It's not compelling in a villain.4. Good v bad women. Bellatrix saying she wishes she had children so she could sacrifice them to Voldemort vs Narcissa desperate to save her son; Lily dying to save her son vs Merope dying despite her son. The reconstruction Dumbledore does of Merope‚Äôs life based on 80% guesswork could not be  patronizing. Having a scene where two male characters discuss how pathetic a woman was for dying during childbirth is not great.5. Ginny is unbearable. Instead of giving her a character arc that would follow from the previous books (she did become a whole different character in OOTP but there‚Äôs little continuity even from OOTP to HBP), she‚Äôs become the school‚Äôs punk rock princess, developed entirely to be Harry‚Äôs gir- trophy wife to the jock king. She‚Äôs a cool girl. She'll fight Hermione, her only depicted friend to defend Harry's honour #standbyyourman. She'll accept Harry dumping her to protect her from Voldemort even though she's written as hating being condescended to and patronized. She's whatever Harry needs, whenever Harry needs her. 6. All the love plots in this book involve women losing their powers or control of themselves because they‚Äôre in love. Tonks, Merope, Hermione. Pass. Snape has been an incel for decades without any loss of powers.7. Ron is written as a misogynist ass and he and Hermione are fundamentally incompatible. They should have realized that and moved on. Really, they come together to parent Harry. Without that, there's not a lot there.8. Luna becomes Ginny‚Äôs pity project. There is a definite shift in Luna‚Äôs character from doing her own thing to sad misfit and I think that‚Äôs a decidedly negative change. Ginny tells people off for calling Luna names in this book when she was doing the exact same thing a year ago, having at the time known Luna for years.",

When Cedric died, he was still a little young to fully understand the impact. However, when Sirius died‚Ä¶he was aware that something wasn‚Äôt right. When we watched the movie, he definitely understood. With this book, I think my son enjoyed the mystery of the Half-Blood Prince the most.

When he discovers who the Half-Blood Prince is probably a better way of putting it. My son loved seeing the past through the Pensieve with Dumbledore.

However, in the light of recent events (aka. Alan Rickman's death), I feel like I have enough inspiration for this review. As you can guess, it will be about Severus Snape (it seems to make sense, since he is the Half-Blood Prince after all.First of all, I have to say something really important: I read HP 1 to 4 at least 15 times each, HP 5 around 5 times and HP 6 and 7 twice each. It means that I have around 67 reading of \"mean-Snape\" and 2 reading of \"have-been-nice-since-the-start-Snape\". That is why I can say that I will never LOVE his character as much as I love others. No matter what. That's being said, I have to say that there is nothing purer and deeper than his love for Lily. I am used to reading about mutual love, or even if that love isn't mutual, in the end, the guy finds someone else to love. This is really the first time I read about an unconditional love, which holds and stays no matter what. It overcame being friend-zoned by Lily, Lily's marriage to James, Lily's having a baby with that same person, and even Lily dying. After all those years, it is still Lily.Moreover, I guess that Slytherin's reputation is hard to get through. Even though I seem to have many qualities that they would like. Severus being one of their students and afterwards becoming their Head didn't help me liking his character. But once again, this book (and the next one) proved me wrong. He is THE Half-Blood Prince. Smart, smarter than his school book, a talented wizard strong in both magic and potions. I mean he fought Voldemort as soon as he knows that the love of his life was in danger, he became a double agent for the Order of the Phoenix, literally putting himself in great danger in order to protect her.‚ÄúI have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter‚Äôs son safe. Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter ‚Äî‚Äù There are a lot of things we get to witness through the books that made my opinion of Severus Snape growing (for instance the frequent bullying of James Potter and Sirius Black, saving Harry in the first book from falling from his broom, killing Dumbledore on his own request). He is faithful to his love for Lily and his vow to Dumbledore, and faithfulness is an awesome quality to my opinion. He is a solitary man with no friends, and he is also capable to use touches of sarcasm with a great ability (and I love sarcastic characters)",

I felt really sorry for her, both Merop and Morfin (her brother) seemed to have some serious problems. Morfin Gaunt was also a very interesting character, he was clearly mad (I always finds Madness interesting, it's horrible, though I like to know how \"mad\" people perceive our reality) and he spoke parseltongue, it's really weird that I wish I could speak parseltongue, isn't it? I love snakes so I just thought it would be kind of cool. Tom Marvalo Riddle, God he was a scary kid, a real psychopath! I wish Dumbledore would just have used a Time Turner to go back in time and kill the boy when he was defenseless! Then, The Half-Blood Prince! Snape, God I love him!!! He is a bit sadistic at times and bullies Harry, but I mean that is nothing compared to what James did to him when they went to school. James stole the love of Snape's life and Harry looks just like James (but with Lily's eyes). Harry is basically a walking reminder of the hell Snape suffered through his Hogwarts time. Snape had many flaws, neither him nor James was innocent to their actions. When I found out that it was Snape who had told Voldermort about the prophecy I was devastated, but he didn't know that it referred to Lily's baby at the time and he regretted it  than anything!

Fawkes the phoenix let out a low, soft, musical cry. To Harry's intense embarrassment, he suddenly realized that Dumbledore's bright blue eyes looked rather watery, and stared hastily at his own knee. When Dumbledore spoke, however, his voice was quite steady. \"I am very touched, Harry.‚Äù ‚ÄúAn Unbreakable Vow?\" said Ron, looking stunned. \"Nah, he can‚Äôt have.... Are you sure?\"\"Yes I‚Äôm sure,\" said Harry. \"Why, what does it mean?\"\"Well, you can‚Äôt break an Unbreakable Vow...\"\"I‚Äôd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough.‚Äù ‚ÄúKilling is not so easy as the innocent believe.‚Äù  ‚ÄúYes, it is easy to see that nearly six years of magical education have not been wasted on you, Potter. Ghosts are transparent.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is your copy of Advanced Potion-Making, is it, Potter?‚Äù‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said Harry, still breathing hard.‚ÄúYou‚Äôre quite sure of that, are you, Potter?‚Äù‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said Harry, with a touch  defiance.‚ÄúThis is the copy of Advanced Potion-Making that you purchased from Flourish and Blotts?‚Äù‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said Harry firmly.‚ÄúThen why,‚Äù asked Snape, ‚Äúdoes it have the name ‚ÄòRoonil Wazlib‚Äô written inside the front cover?‚ÄùHarry‚Äôs heart missed a beat. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my nickname,‚Äù he said.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI would rather die than betray his trust.\"\"That's not saying much, seeing as you're already dead,\" Ron observed.\"Once again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe,\" said Nearly Headless Nick in affronted tones.‚Äù ‚ÄúKill me then,' panted Harry, who felt no fear at all, but only rage and contempt. 'Kill me like you killed him, you coward-'DON'T-' screamed Snape, and his face was suddenly demented, inhuman, as though he was in as much pain as the yelping, howling dog stuck in the house behind them- 'CALL ME A COWARD!‚Äù ‚ÄúSometimes you remind me a lot of James. He called it my 'furry little problem' in company. Many people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved rabbit.‚Äù ‚ÄúHarry looked around; there was Ginny running toward him; she had a hard blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him.

This is where Harry Potter doesn't fall short, and why it seems so very timeless a tale.I lapped this up hungrily because to me, this book in the series is the turning point of all the others. We see the clear signs of the missing pieces coming together, and Severus Snape is proving to become a very tragic, misunderstood character although how much is not very clear yet. I find that's one of the most dynamic thing that I love very much in Rowling's magical universe. We don't just get a complex, imaginative world and quirky characters, we get to see the growth of the storyline, the people we come to care about deeply and how they all overcome the adversities before them. Harry Potter isn't just merely light vs dark, there are many gray areas too, and Rowling showcased that in a rather complex manner. December 2015 I AM NOT CRYING. YOU ARE.",

That book can toss my salad with a side of Go Fuck Yourself dressing.Where was I? Oh yeah...While I've seen the movies, I completely forgot about the significant death scene at the end of this one. I think that's because I slept through the important parts of the final three films. I had a serious what the fuck moment at the end of this one, thinking to myself, \"He can't die. He's in the next book.\" While I was both wrong and right, I cannot believe I missed him dying in this one. That being said, his death was my favorite part of this book. Not that I didn't like the character, but because Rowling took a big chance killing him.Dan 2.0 mentioned that he was interested in how I, being a horror fan, would feel about the cave scene, so this paragraph is for him. I think being a horror fan actually detracted from my enjoyment of that section. Dead people just below the surface of the water goes as far back as Lord of the Rings. It has been used countless times throughout the genre. Most recently, The Woman in Black used this tactic. That's funny because Daniel Radcliffe is in both film adaptations. Anyway, the cave scene felt dated, but at the same time well written. Of course this goes back to Rowling's overuse use of the borrow button. But there's nothing new under the sun, right? Not every book can be The Fold. ;)To those of you expecting a rage review, my apologies. I think those days are behind us, at least where this series is concerned. Spoiler alert, I actually liked the next book too. In summation: Everyone told me these books got better, but I did not believe them. Took me longer to get invested than most, but it finally happened. While I still don't care about these characters nearly enough to fan flail over their deaths and successes, I understand why some do.

Deaths have always been present in the series but we are now far from the muted treatments of the first books.Dumbledore finally enlists Harry‚Äôs help in their fight against Voldemort, and I for one really enjoyed the sections showing us the origin story of Tom Riddle. It made him  human in a way, or rather less of a god-like figure.We still have plenty of humour, thankfully, such as the scene with the Muggle Prime Minister or life at Hogwarts, to give us moments of laughter to break the tension. Additionally, for a novel focusing  and  on the battle against evil, much emphasis is put on feelings, such as filial love, teenage infatuation, real (and false) love, friendship, courage, redemption, etc. Rowling is echoing Dumbledore‚Äôs belief in the power of the heart.Theories on the structure of the series abound but I do like the one that proposes that all 7 books can be folded at book 4, making Prisoner of Azkaban joined with Order of the Phoenix, and indeed Chamber of Secrets with the Half-Blood Prince. There are many parallels, such as Tom Riddle‚Äôs diary and the Potions coursebook, Ginny, Parseltongue, etc. And  can indeed be seen in book 1 and 7.There is also a kind of expectant feeling cursing through the whole novel, just under the surface - a preparation for the real events, as indeed it is. This is the only book in the series that does not have a real ending, but sets up the Quest for the final instalment. Usually this would weaken the story but that is not the case in this instance. On the contrary, it resonates strongly, even  so in this re-reading.",
        "It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing . This book in the series for me is where it all changes and in a good way trust me, The half blood prince is about the trio getting ready to leave the safety of Hogwarts and begin there journey looking for the Horcruxes.

Plot:  The story shifts in this one and its a major shift because i know that Harry is wanting to leave and go off and search for the remaining horcruxes to finally defeat Voldemort once and for all. To me this book was darker and  mature and in its own right with Harry now being 16 and exploring  mature content. One thing that i liked about this series is the story grew with Harry and now that he is in his sixth year of schooling things are becoming  mature. Ron has  fun in this book then he ever has and even though he is hurting Hermione in the process which i didn't like. Harry is starting to learn about Horcruxes and how Voldemort is using them and what he needs to do to destroy them and finally take Voldemort down once and for all. Let us step into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure. Even though this wasn't one of my favourite books in the series i still enjoyed it a lot because everything is starting to come together and we start to get a clear idea on were Harry is going and what he needs to do in order to defeat Voldemort.",

I liked all the characters here. (Hagrid didn't irritate me this time!). This book again points out that men are idiots (I am a man and God! I am weird!). I was going to say  but kind of forgot..... I loved the final chapters. I love snape! He is the best, always! Looking forward to reading Deathly Hallows. Thank you for reading this, something of a review. :)",

A few that stood out to me:1. Harry & Ginny, their romance is done so much better in the book than in the movies. I love them so adorable!2. Of course Ron & Hermione! Even though they are still kind of denying their feelings in this book you could still see the truth. Best couple ever<33. Dumbledore. There was so much Dumbledore in this book! I love his witty, yet wise attitude & how he just happens to know the answers to his questions before they are even answered. He is just such a great man.4. I loved the scene where Harry takes Felix Felicis to get the memory from Slughorn, so hilarious! \"You've got a good feeling about burying a giant spider?\" asked Ron, looking stunned.\"Yeah,\" said Harry, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag. \"I feel like it's the place to be tonight, you know what I mean?\" \"No,\" said Ron and Hermione together, both looking positively alarmed now.5. Even though it was creepy, it was so interesting to learn about Voldemort's childhood and his time at Hogwarts.6. Hogwarts, the magic, everything else! J.K. Rowling really does write in a way to make you feel like you're at Hogwarts with Harry!I'm going to give my heart a break, from the crying & heartbreak and wait a little bit before I read Deathly Hallows.

        "There is an popular school of thought which says that as soon as an author becomes very successful (in the sense that people might actually buy their books rather than the Guardian Review section stating the author has a narrative voice reminiscent of early Banana Yoshimoto), it is pure intellectual snobbery to claim that he or she is nowhere near as talented as is generally suggested and that other, far  obscure writers are considerably better and  worthy of adulation.This is, of courseThere is an popular school of thought which says that as soon as an author becomes very successful (in the sense that people might actually buy their books rather than the Guardian Review section stating the author has a narrative voice reminiscent of early Banana Yoshimoto), it is pure intellectual snobbery to claim that he or she is nowhere near as talented as is generally suggested and that other, far  obscure writers are considerably better and  worthy of adulation.This is, of course, sometimes true, but in general it's just so much hot air, designed to help people avoid any actual thinking about whatever it is that they're reading and to instead continue to believe that high book sales are a sure fire sign of literary quality.In fact, extremely popular authors tend to fall into two categories.First and best, are those writers who are genuinely very good at all levels of what they do (Terry Pratchett for the fantasy/sf crowd; Marian Keyes for the chick-litters and so on) - their writing is solid and well-done, their ideas are witty and original; their characters, within the scope of their chosen genre, rounded and believable. In general, no-one tends to come out and say 'Terry Pratchett is a very poor writer of dialogue', for the simple reason that evidently he isn't.The second group are those authors who really aren't very good at writing, but who can churn out intriguing, if often illogical, plots which hold the attention in much the same way that soap operas do. Jeffrey Archer although apparently a self-serving ex-criminal, is the most obvious example of this second breed (as a teenager I once read Archer's Kane and Abel whilst on a family holiday in a B&B in Fort William and it was perfectly acceptable stuff - certainly much  attention-grabbing than the pile of Zane Grey westerns which were the place's only other literary offerings). People frequently do come out and say things like 'Jeffrey Archer is a very poor writer of dialogue' which is fair enough comment because equally evidently he is exactly that. Which is not to say that he can't tell a story - and that is an accusation not often levelled at him.All of which apparent digression brings me to JK Rowling's penultimate Harry Potter book, \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\". One in three hardbacks sold in the UK are written by Ms Rowling and, if the papers are to be believed, she made ¬£20 million in the first day of sale of this novel. The series regularly tops reader polls as best children's books ever and Ms Rowling is now the richest woman in Britain (possibly the Universe). She was even, it is rumoured, invited by Russell T Davies to write a story for the rebirth of smsh hit tv series, \"Doctor Who\". To suggest that Ms Rowling is a less than stellar writer and that - for instance - Ursula K LeGuin's \"Earthsea\" trilogy is so far above Harry Potter as to be invisible is presumably just the type of intellectual snobbery mentioned above.And yet her new book is - and apologies in advance for the profanity - bloody awful.So awful that it would never have been published had it been written by anyone other than JKR.So awful that even the sycophantic drone at Bloomsbury who...ahem...edits the Rowling manuscripts must have winced.So awful that even the author appears to recognise that she's putting no effort in any .So awful that everyone involved should be throughly ashamed of themselves.\"The Half-Blood Prince\" has the story's hero spending much of his time (several hundred pages in fact) doing something which does not need doing, simply in order (a) to have him doing anything at all and (b) waste some time. Dumbledore clearly already knows what has passed between Professor Slughorn and Lord Voldemort, so there is no need for Harry to spend so much time on the subject, other than artificially boosting the pagecount. What makes this particuarly galling is that Rowling knows that what she's doing is rubbish - there's even an explicit reference to the fact that the hero need not have been Harry but could just as easily have been the ineffectual Neville.We should, however, really be glad that Rowling's third-rate rip-off of the Origins of Gollum section of Lord of the Rings (which makes up much of the 'plot' and which is the supposed reason for Harry's enquiries of Slughorn) does take up such an incredibly large part of the book as it at least prevents Rowling shoe-horning in yet  tedious, badly written and shallow bits of teenage love and snogging. This is a book bought mainly by ten to fourteen year olds after all, and if they want romantic teen angst they can presumably go out and buy a Jacqueline Wilson book, rather than this hand-me-down tat.In any case, once the 'Lord Voldemort is Smeagol' and 'Harry meets Ginny' sections are over, there's only about 150 pages left of the 607 page book and we're heading helter-skelter for the Obligatory Dead Hero section of the book - by my count this is the third book in a row where one of the good guys is killed.Surprisingly perhaps, given the emotional impact Rowling managed to put into the death of Sirius Black in the last book, the O.D.H here is just as poorly done as the rest of the book, and although you can easily conjecture ways in which the scene might make  sense and have a greater impact in light of the final book in the series, it's very hard to care enough to try. Which is something of an achievement in itself when you're talking about the death of a key and sympathetic character the reader has been following for five previous books.Which leaves the mystery of just who is the Half-Blood Prince? Who cares? The solution in the end is a Pull-the-Never-Mentioned-Previously-Rabbit-Out-the-Hat affair that you couldn't possibly have guessed given the available evidence, but it doesn't matter because you won't care. The character of the Half-Blood Prince, once revealed, is neither believable, nor interesting, nor even very necessary. It's just  page-filler, saying in fifty thousand words what a good writer could have said in fifteen (not 15 thousand, just 15).'Harry is tempted to cut corners and can be a little bit bad sometimes' - there you go, that's only 14 and I'm not a writer of any description.As someone recently mentioned on one of the mailing lists I frequent, the whole 'Harry thinks Snape is up to no good, Ron and Hermoine aren't sure, and Dumbledore isn't saying' shtick is now well past its sell-by date and increasingly seems to be the only idea Rowling has for a Potter book. Here that idea reaches a potential conclusion and, frankly, I was bored stupid by just how lacklustre, lazy and badly done it all was.",

Also, when will people finally realize that Draco Malfoy isn't a villain. WHEN. Yes, he used to be such a spoiled brat and he did a lot of things that weren't alright but he is not a villain. This book shows very clearly that he got forced into being a death eater. He doesn't have a choice. It's either doing what he's asked to do or die himself.What really broke my heart was the scene in the cave and how all of this ends for Dumbledore.

The sixth book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, reintroduces Harry's stubbornness, in the form of his addiction to the book of the Half-Blood Prince. In addition, his obsession with his parents comes to the surface again; in book three he already thought his father conjured a Patronus to save him (which actually was his own Patronus), now he is convinced the mysterious book is written by the young James. I really liked the peek into \"the real world\"; this book starts with the prime minister of the British Muggles, being informed about the terrifying situation in the wizard world, which is now also influencing the Muggle world. You are reminded that in fact, there is no such thing as \"two worlds\"; everything that happens in either communities, also influences the others.Lastly, obviously, the ending was intense.

So much so that even Muggle governments are starting to notice something is wrong. Ron constantly searches The Daily Prophet daily for familiar names, and Dumbledore is absent from Hogwarts for days at a time, and the Order of the Phoenix has already suffered heavy losses. But, as in all wars, life goes on. Sixth years learn to Apparate, the Weasley twins expand their business, and teenagers flirt, fight, and fall in love. Classes are harder than ever, but Harry manages to find some incredible help from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince. I have to admit: Voldemort has one of my all time favorite villain backstories. It‚Äôs so complex and developed and I love reading about it every time, and love how J.K. Rowling chose to incorporate his background through the Pensieve. It adds so much to it (especially visually!) and is genuinely one of the coolest ways to learn about someone. The development to the plot and the war is also so fantastic, and despite this book not being my favorite in the series, it‚Äôs so damn incredible and I‚Äôm constantly in awe by how much goes on in just 652 pages. This might be an odd thing to say, but I also really do love how dark this series gets, especially in this one (also... kind of literally. Dementors make the world darker). So much for this being a children‚Äôs series, as people love to say.All of the characters also go through even  amazing development. Harry, my sweet boy, who has had to deal with so much shit he never deserved, is truly one of the most incredible characters ever written. He deserves so much  credit than people give him, if I‚Äôm being honest. I also have to say, it‚Äôs incredible how he manages to keep going and keep fighting a war he wants nothing to do with despite it all. And, on top of that, he‚Äôs still so normal, which is something I‚Äôve always loved about these characters. He deals with obnoxious teachers and homework and learning about his own feelings for Ginny. I still don‚Äôt like Ginny, but what's new. The way she, Hermione, and Molly treat Fleur is disgusting and I still can‚Äôt believe no one calls them out for it, like... ever. I also love Harry and Luna‚Äôs friendship, and Luna in general, and I wish we got  of them together. ‚ÄúVoldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back!‚ÄùAm I about to write a whole ass paragraph on Draco Malfoy and how he deserves better? Yes, of course I am. Because he really fucking does. It‚Äôs amazing that there are still people out there believe he‚Äôs a villain, and that his own author still calls him a villain, because it‚Äôs very clear he‚Äôs a scared child put in a position no sixteen year old should ever have to be put in, who handled it the way he thought was best. He did what he had to do to stay alive and to keep his family alive. Like, do people think Voldemort would have let the Malfoy‚Äôs live if Draco said no? Absolutely not. Draco will forever be one of my favorite characters, and I really, really wish we got  of his perspective from his own point of view rather than Harry‚Äôs. Especially considering how much he grows up and changes in such a short amount of time. The scene in the bathroom still makes me so damn upset.Anyway. Moving on. I want to talk about Dumbledore for a minute. I never hated and loved a character as much as him. Which, if I‚Äôm being honest, is a compliment, because it goes to show how well written he is (at least to me). I do think, despite everything, Dumbledore really does love Harry quite a bit. And we all know Harry really loves and looks up to him, too. The cave scene is so heartbreaking,  so for Harry, but it watching Dumbledore go through so much pain always hurts  than I ever expect it to. Also, on a lighter note, what a hilarious, ridiculous old man. The scene with the Dursley‚Äôs is really great (even if it is a little frightening, especially considering what we learn about Dumbledore in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, but it's fine. Vernon and Petunia kind of deserve it).Overall, I obviously loved Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. No matter how much it hurts, I love how J.K. Rowling takes no mercies with her characters and understands that sometimes, characters have to go to further along the development, even if we hate it (and we certainly do). It would be unrealistic to keep everyone alive, and she knows it. That being said, this series is hard on my heart and emotions and even though it's necessary, I really kind of hate it, you know? I love seeing how much development Rowling puts in one book and seeing how much the characters and world has changed since the beginning. Remember when this series kind of presented itself as a nice little book about a magical boarding school? Rowling said \"lol, bitch you thought.\" Either way, this book was so great to get back into and I‚Äôm so excited to get to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows soon.‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you should be an Auror, Harry,‚Äù said Luna unexpectedly.

Rowling like before, Harry Potter will always be my favourite series of all time. There were certain problematic aspects of the book, which might‚Äôve skipped my attention when I first read it a few years back. I haven‚Äôt reduced the rating because Half-Blood Prince is my favourite book in the series, I‚Äôm only savvier about the problematic aspects.Why are Love potions on sale? Shouldn‚Äôt the Ministry of Magic ban the manufacture and sale of such dangerous products? Merope drugged Voldemort‚Äôs father with a love-potion. I know that‚Äôs how Voldemort would be born without love and is devoid of any emotion, but it still is non-consensual sex. Even Fred and George sell love potions at Weasley Wizard Wheezes which eventually makes its way into Hogwarts. Romilda Vane wants to give Harry a Love potion so she could take him to a Christmas party. Why using and selling love potions is such a light affair? How is that even acceptable? There are other products sold that are dangerous (to the Wizarding World), but no, The Ministry wouldn‚Äôt take any actions.‚ÄúPeruvian Instant Darkness Powder,‚Äù said Ron bitterly. ‚ÄúFred and George‚Äôs. I‚Äôm going to be having a word with them about who they let buy their products.‚ÄùI love Harry, but seldom his actions are annoying. He‚Äôs in grief after Sirius‚Äôs death but blaming Snape for it is wrong. More so, because he feels good about it. Hermione is dominating, but she knows what is right. She warns Harry against going to The Ministry in The Order of The Pheonix and Harry must be seeing what Voldemort wants him to see. If I remember it right, even Snape warns Sirius against going to the Ministry. Sirius died because of his own egotistical and reckless behaviour.Harry clung to this notion because it enabled him to blame Snape, which felt satisfying, and also because he knew that if anyone was not sorry that Sirius was dead, it was the man now striding next to him in the darkness.Hermione even warned Harry not to trust the Half-Blood Prince‚Äôs Potions book, but he does not also consider before casting spells that he‚Äôs not even heard of. What if one of the spells killed someone? In a duel with Draco Malfoy who almost casts Crucio, Harry casts Sectumsempra without being aware of its consequence, and he only gets detention for it. Also, a student who is casting Crucio, an unforgivable curse which is a one-way ticket to Azkaban, be punished for it as well? Besides, if Harry enjoyed the popularity he had because of the Half-Blood Prince‚Äôs Potions book, he should‚Äôve worked hard for it from the beginning and should‚Äôve had the audacity to return the book back.I hate Ginny  than ever. She is a stereotypical YA female character, written as bold and brave but is rather rude and cruel. Ginny insults Fleur, call her phlegm. Mrs Weasley and Hermione didn‚Äôt like Fleur either, but they didn‚Äôt call her names. Ginny hexes Zacarius Smith because he annoyed her. Really? And she gets invited to the Slug Club for it!‚ÄúHe saw me hex Zacharias Smith,‚Äù said Ginny. ‚ÄúYou remember that idiot from Hufflepuff who was in the D.A.? He kept on, and on asking about what happened at the Ministry and in the end he annoyed me so much I hexed him.‚ÄùShe insults Hermione because she can‚Äôt play Quidditch. Just because you can play Quidditch does not mean everyone can, or everyone should pay for that matter. I‚Äôve never liked Ginny, and I couldn‚Äôt care less about her and Harry‚Äôs romance. It felt forced and overwhelming.‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt start acting as though you understand Quidditch,‚Äù snapped Ginny, ‚Äúyou‚Äôll only embarrass yourself.‚ÄùLikewise, I hate James Potter. I don‚Äôt understand Hogwart‚Äôs notion of bravery. James Potter, other than refusing to join the Dark Side and sacrificing his life to save his family, what other actions of his manifests bravery? Unless bullying counts as bravery because you‚Äôre a bloody Gryffindor!‚ÄúCoward, did you call me, Potter?‚Äù shouted Snape. ‚ÄúYour father would never attack me unless it were four on one, what would you call him, I wonder?‚ÄùEven Hermione‚Äôs action irked me. She attacked Ron because she feels entitled to his feelings and affection and seeing him going out with Lavender upset her.‚ÄúOppugno!‚Äù came a shriek from the doorway.Harry spun around to see Hermione pointing her wand at Ron, her expression wild: The little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward Ron, who yelped and covered his face with his hands, but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach.Horace Slughorn is quite vain. He collects famous students as trophies, even those who possess no talent whatsoever but belongs to well-known and reputable families. No matter how many times I read the Half-Blood Prince, Dumbledore‚Äôs death will always be a blow considering how much he meant to Harry and to (almost) everyone else at school and how invaluable his help could‚Äôve been in times of war.Apart from the points mentioned above, I love Half-Blood Prince. I might review the other books in the series in the future, or I might just do a blog post about the problematic aspects of each book. It‚Äôs easier to point out what you didn‚Äôt like than stating what and why you love it, sometimes because it‚Äôs too personal.‚ÄúI am not worried, Harry,‚Äù said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. ‚ÄúI am with you.‚Äù",

This makes me want to crack them open and learn every little detail.One of my favorite aspects of this book was learning Voldemort's past. Several times Harry and Dumbledore used the pensive to look at certain memories. These so called 'lessons' for Harry were just a way to find out how to destroy Voldemort for good.

The charming story that began when Harry Potter and his friends were eleven has slowly grown  mature and dark as the Hogwart‚Äôs students have progressed. The children are now 17 and in their sixth year, Rowling goes full EVIL SORCEROR and shocks us with some a heady brew of Bradburyesque dark arts.Some fans will lament that the magical charm of the earlier books is lost in this narrative, but contextually, the antagonism with the strengthening Lord Voldemort has led us here and Rowling gives us another very entertaining story in the Harry Potter universe.Harry borrows a potions book for class and discovers that a previous student calling himself the ‚ÄúHalf Blood Prince‚Äù had all the notes to help Harry breeze through even the most delicate concoctions and even had some home-grown spells to work out. This discovery leads to  adventure culminating in a showdown with Voldemort‚Äôs Death Eaters.Professor Severus Snape (played so brilliantly by Alan Rickman in the films) has been a source of animosity for Harry since the first book and his complicated nature has been artfully developed by Rowling over the course of the series until now we are faced with a very complex dynamic.A compelling penultimate visit with Harry and an invitation to the last book.

At this point, it feels like JK Rowling just gave up trying. The series got popular, people would buy anything with her name on it, so what was the point coming up with an interesting plot when she could just recycle what she'd done with the past 2 books: blab on about nothing of substance and irrelevant details for 500 pages and then kill off a beloved side character so that everyone would forget that the story actually has no plot. This might've even worked if the characters were actually likable and interesting and the death scenes were well written. Unfortunately, Harry Potter and his friends are insufferable, and JK Rowling can't write a death scene to save her life. I've had to backtrack all three times an \"important\" character has died so far, because it happens so quickly. One minute they're alive, next minute they aren't. There's no emotion, no real reason they died, no consequences to their death (except Harry has  to complain about now). It's just a cheap way for JK Rowling to evoke emotion from readers. There was kind of two plots of this book; Voldemort's origin story, and Harry and friends angsting at Hogwarts. The pensieve memories felt like Rowling's attempt to show rather than tell us Voldemort's history, but it ended up being a massive info-dump, comprised mostly of information that either the reader already knew, or that had no major relevance to the story. I understand wanting to know your enemies, but it took up way too much of the book and became boring after the second memory. I also thought that it was a massive cop out to have Voldemort be born evil. Where's the motive? I was really hoping to learn why he's so evil, what the driving force of his actions is. But no, he was just born that way (which completely contradicts Dumbledore's whole speech about how Harry can choose his fate and to be good and isn't being forced into being the 'chosen one', but oh well).Speaking of Harry, can he just stop? I'm so done with him. This entire book was him angsting over Ginny (who he had never been remotely interested in and then all of a sudden he desperately wants to make out with her? Insta love much?), obsessively stalking Malfoy, and being stupid. I'll start with Ginny. She's a total Mary Sue. She literally just exists so that the reader can pretend that they're dating Harry. She gets away with everything (she hexes a guy and gets invited to a teacher's party, she flies her broomstick into someone and is cheered on etc) and she has zero personality. She's boring and rude. And of course, Harry breaks up with her at the end of the book to be heroic or something, and she doesn't seem to care, and he doesn't seem to care, so why the hell should I care? They've barely been together a month anyway, and Harry's reasoning makes no sense. He doesn't want her to get hurt (she can decide that for herself), and yet he's totally fine with Ron and Hermione coming with him? Doesn't make sense, unless he doesn't care enough about Ron and Hermione to protect them like he does Ginny, or just doesn't think Ginny is as capable as them. Either way, both make me hate him  than I already did, which is saying a lot. I also hated his obsession with Malfoy. It got old really quickly, and I was bored of his constant attempts to convince everyone Malfoy was evil after 200 pages of it. His priorities just felt really off. He should have been focusing on Dumbledore's lessons, he should've been trying to learn Occlumency (because, as he learned in the previous book, it's kind of an important skill when you're trying to fight evil dudes who can read your mind), but no, he was too busy following Malfoy around. But my biggest issue with this, is that it made the entire book so predictable that I wanted to pull out my hair and set the book on fire. When the protagonist of a book spends the entire book trying to convince everyone that a certain person is part of an evil organisation led by the most evil wizard of the past century, it's a little obvious when said person turns out to be a part of this organisation. It's also pretty obvious that Malfoy was supposed to kill Dumbledore. You'd think that someone would work out that the only use Voldemort had of a 16 year old was their access to Hogwarts, and therefore Dumbledore, but nope. Either way, what should have been a big reveal was so plainly obvious that even someone as stupid as Harry Potter could figure it out. Speaking of Harry's stupidity, I honestly don't know why he thought it was a good idea to take advice from the Half-Blood Prince (who was so obviously Snape, I mean, who do we know that's amazing at both potions and the dark arts and was around when the levicorpus spell was being used?). Hermione told him multiple times that it was a bad idea, Ginny reminded him of Riddle's diary (a seemingly innocent book that turned out to be anything but) and, you know, common sense. But no, he was too lazy to do his homework, so he ignored everyone's advice (again) and it didn't end well for him (again). What I found interesting in this book, is that even when pure-of-heart Harry learned what the Sectumsempra curse did, he still attempted to use it multiple times on Snape, as well as other unforgivable curses on Snape and Malfoy. Why does Harry get to remain pure at heart and so unquestionably good whilst also using these terrible curses on people, but when others use them, they're evil? Oh that's right, Harry Potter is perfect and can't do wrong, even when attempting to torture people. Look, I'm not opposed to characters killing others, but there needs to be consequences to their actions. And it feels like there's never any real consequences to Harry's actions. He may lose a couple house points (but Gryffindor always wins anyways, so who cares?), but it doesn't ever feel like he's in danger because he almost appears invincible, purely because his actions always go unpunished and are forgotten by the next book. I want suspense, I want to truly believe that at any moment, Harry could be killed, but I just don't. And that ruins the story for me.There was also the issue of Hermione and Ron, both of whom were growing on me, but after this book, I've lost all respect for them. I'll start with Ron. He was jealous that 2 years ago, Hermione kissed a guy, so in response, despite the fact that he was not dating Hermione at the time of the kiss or in the present, he snogged Lavender, who liked him, in front of Hermione (constantly), made Lavender think that he liked her back (when he actually liked Hermione), was incredibly mean to Hermione without telling her why, and never apologised to Lavender for leading her on and using her to make Hermione jealous. He was also very whiny throughout the book, and just annoyed the hell out of me with his constant complaining about Hermione, quidditch and apparition. Hermione was even worse though. She basically was a completely different person in this book. I understand character development, but this was just ridiculous. The smart and rational Hermione from the previous novels vanished, and was replaced with one who spent her days moping about Ron and criticising Harry whenever she got the chance. She attacked Ron with birds for making out with Lavender, even though she and Ron weren't dating, she specifically sought out someone to take to Slughorn's party that she knew would hurt Ron, she cheated in the quidditch tryouts (and Harry just let it happen), and she was almost as unbearable to read about as Harry. But then Ron nearly died, and all of a sudden he and Hermione are fine? There was no communication, no apologies, no nothing. They never resolved their issues. I wanted  Luna throughout this book, as well. It felt like she was becoming  of an important character, but she was just shoved aside in this book. So was Neville. After what happened at the Ministry, you would expect them to be closer friends, but after the (admittedly adorable) scene on the train, we saw hardly nothing of either of them. It almost feels like the events of the previous book never happened, making the series as a whole feel disjointed. This is made worse by the fact that nothing happens in these books until the last 100 pages. I'm done ranting about this book now, I'd rather not give it any  of my time. Final thoughts: I hate all the characters except Luna and the Weasley twins, there was no plot until the last 100 pages, and what plot we got was predictable. This book could have been 200 pages, but I doubt I'd like it even then. The series doesn't feel like it was planned out before it was started, and so now JK Rowling has run out of plot and is just filling the books leading up to the finale with teen angst and schoolwork. I'd like to think that Deathly Hallows will be worth the crap I've had to endure in the last 2 books, but I doubt it.",

Head on my shoulder he became completely unable to read, and yet completely unable to stop, and I had to read pretty much the final three chapters myself, as he returned to weep in his shirt.

Oddment! Tweak!.My Review of Harry Potter and Order of the Phoenix...1st read in August 2014‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê/5 (9.0/10)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is an eye-opener. J.K. Rowling lets the reader dive into Voldemort‚Äôs past. Harry understands why Voldemort is who he is and what Voldemort‚Äôs principles are. This information is very satisfactory for the reader because by knowing the mystery that is Lord Voldemort, the mystery gets unraveled. Harry shows bravery as he has never shown before. (view spoiler)[At the end of the book he chooses to walk into the arena with his head held high, instead of being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death. Harry is not afraid of death. Harry wants Voldemort finished and he wants to be the one who does it. Because one of them must die, one of them is going to end up killing the other. It is the way it is supposed to be.  (hide spoiler)]Harry‚Äôs bravery is the key point of the novel, without it the novel wouldn‚Äôt be as exhilarating and exciting. He is a true Gryffindor. The novel has a lot of important and surprising turning points. (view spoiler)[Finding out that even Dumbledore can make a misjudgment in character is very painful for the whole wizarding world, especially Dumbledore himself. For the mistake resulted in his demise. It comes as a great shock to see him die. The reader might think it was a hoax or a trick, however, when it is eventually realised that it is an ugly truth, all one can do is read on and hope for brighter days. I am very sad to see Dumbledore go. Harry now has no mentors to guide him any. His parents, his godfather, his headmaster they are all dead. The only people he has left are his friends, Dumbledore‚Äôs Army and the Order of the Phoenix. Godspeed, Harry.  (hide spoiler)]Harry‚Äôs loyalty to Dumbledore is awe-inspiring and simply wonderful. (view spoiler)[Even after he has been murdered, Harry is loyal to him. Because he knows that Dumbledore will never be truly gone if there are still people who remain loyal to him. This relationship is one which will never be broken, the Dark Lord cannot break the true and faithful hearts of Dumbledore‚Äôs Army. (hide spoiler)] The relationships between the characters make the novel so worthwhile. They are realistic; there might be disputes but a strong friendship can overcome anything. ‚Äò‚ÄòDumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right,‚Äô‚Äô - Hermione, p.95 ‚Äò‚ÄòGreatness inspires envy, envy engenders spite, spite spawns lies.‚Äô‚Äô - Tom Riddle or as he would love to be called Lord Voldemort, p.415(view spoiler)[\"You are protected, in short, by your ability to love!\" said Dumbledore loudly. \"The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemort‚Äôs!

        "Amazing, as always.",
        "This series is marvelous, really I'm so impressed I can't find the right words to describe how much I loved this book. Harry has grown considerably during this story. The romance in this book was heart touching and hilarious at the same time. The ending though, it broke my heart. I was crying so hard I had to close the book in order to get a grip of myself. All in all, I loved it and I'm both excited and nervous about reading the final book.",
        "Although this wasn't the first Harry Potter book I read on my own, it's the only book I have a memory of reading for the first time. I'm sure I've written about it in a review before, but I'm going to recount it -- briefly -- here. We were in Japan, on a night train. (I already felt pretty magical, being in a foreign place AND being on a night train meant I could pretend I was on the Knight Bus.) Shut myself up with this book, and the only memory I have is of eagerly reading \"The Cave\", vividly Although this wasn't the first Harry Potter book I read on my own, it's the only book I have a memory of reading for the first time. I'm sure I've written about it in a review before, but I'm going to recount it -- briefly -- here. We were in Japan, on a night train. (I already felt pretty magical, being in a foreign place AND being on a night train meant I could pretend I was on the Knight Bus.) Shut myself up with this book, and the only memory I have is of eagerly reading \"The Cave\", vividly imagining myself there, too, with Harry and Dumbledore, battling the Inferni.This is my favorite Harry Potter book. The memories, the feeling of it really coming together , the story and the mystery on two levels. Who is the Half-Blood Prince? What is Malfoy up to? It enticed me as a child, and still gets me to this very day.It's a great book, and it shows JK's real depth of knowledge with this series. I can't imagine the world-building she did for this series, and every time I read it I find it utterly incredible to see little details that show it again and again.Now that I've gotten the gushing out of the way, the rest of my review is going to be focused on a character. I ran a poll for this, because I couldn't decide. The poll results were that I talk about my opinions and feelings about Dumbledore. Aka, this is where I spoil book seven if you haven't read it already, and maybe also make you hate me a bit.I have a real love/hate relationship with Dumbledore's character now that I'm older. When I was younger, I was very much like Harry; I was in awe of Dumbledore, and I thought he could do no wrong. As I grew, I still felt that, but I also could see things that he shouldn't have done. I still thought he was a great character, a trustworthy one. Now, I'm very conflicted. Throughout this series, I've been reading for Dumbledore's character, and I can honestly say I feel  enlightened now that I have. Yet, I'm conflicted. On one hand, I see Dumbledore as an amazing mentor who is flawed, but aren't all adults? He made some bad choices, ones that haunted him for the rest of his life and, again, what adult hasn't done that? Then, on the other hand I see him, again, as very flawed. However, I see him as power hungry. Not in the political sphere, but in another way. Knowledge. Defeating people. And, what we discover about his past in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows doesn't make that feeling go away, merely strengthen it.One of my favorite things, which ties into this, on the internet with theories is about The Three Brothers analogy. Voldemort is the first, power hungry, brother. Snape is the second brother, who pines for the past. Harry is the third brother, who welcomes Death as an old friend. And Dumbledore is Death. It's a great analogy.I can see pieces of Dumbledore in all of them.Voldemort, of course, is extremely power hungry. But, he and Dumbledore are, in a way, alike. As we find out in the final book, we know that Dumbledore was involved with another dark wizard. He agreed that wizards are best and Muggles need to be, slightly, put in their place. He plotted a takeover. The power got to his head, as you see it happen throughout the series in front of you. Dumbledore and finding out that Voldemort has his body back; a new challenge, something new to take down. Dumbledore and the Horcruxes. Dumbledore and the Deathly Hallows. He is drawn to power. Perhaps he doesn't want it for himself, but it entices him. Which makes him somewhat like Voldemort.On the other hand, Dumbledore is incredibly like Snape. Snape will have a whole review dedicated to him, don't worry. He pines for the past, which people know if you've read the whole series. Dumbledore does as well. He never forgives himself for involving himself with a dark wizard and the terrible outcome of that: His sister's death. In \"The Cave\" chapter, you see that so vividly, and it honestly hurts to read it. You can imagine that anguish, that deep hatred for yourself. And... it hurts.And, finally, there's Harry. Dumbledore welcomes death. He is not afraid of it, seeing it as an inevitable end and the next great adventure. After so many years of escaping it, he finally meets it because there's no other way.Dumbledore is one of the most complex characters I've met in a children's book. When you're young, you can see him as perfect. The older you get, the  flaws you see. It's incredible what JK Rowling created, and I don't ever think I'll be able to put a finger on exactly how I feel about him.",

After a slow start, the momentum picks up like a snow ball rolling down an icy cliff until a the breathtaking, unnerving, and unflinching climax. Rowling stays true to form the entire ride. The characters become deeper and  thoughtful in a well-written book of imagination and originality. Rowling doesn't dumb down her characters; she illustrates them as they should be... as real, complicated teenagers. As such, Harry, Ron, and Hermione (and to some extent, Ginny) have matured considerably since the previous book. They are now older teenagers and are developing strong ties to the opposite sex.Ultimately, the central theme is discovering who Lord Voldemort really is. Much is learned about Voldemort in this novel, a brilliant setup for what will most likely be a spectacular showdown in the final novel . There are other subplots galore, of course, that I‚Äôm guessing will tie up the various loose ends in book 7.This book is not rushed; it has no rushed ending. It is filled with insight and emotion. It is a much darker and much  ‚Äúadult‚Äù book, especially the last quarter of the book. Obviously, the novel is a setup for the final showdown. It leaves the reader hanging off of a cliff, but it is written with beauty and flawless description. Rowling gives her audience a realistic portrait of human souls in a fantasy world. I felt  character depth in this novel than any of the others.Besides all the beauty and imagination, this book is relentless, transcending the level mere entertainment. It gives depth and wonder. It expands on the characters, not just the events. It has the usual mind-boggling wonders and creative new inventions. The ending was incredibly moving and sets up questions in the reader's mind as to what‚Äôs coming in the final volume.It could be argued that ‚ÄúHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince‚Äù is the best of the series so far. Given what has come before, that is saying a lot. Harry is growing up before the reader‚Äôs eyes, and one can't help rooting for him to prevail. Regardless of what the future holds, the present holds many rich wonders for readers and the hints of the possibilities to come are tantalizing.",

The whispered rumours of Lord Voldemort's return are no longer hushed up by propaganda, but instead full-blown and verified, and there's this impending sense of doom throughout the novel which suggests that something terrible is going to happen... however, it's not all darkness. Harry, in taking potions class, acquires by chance a copy of a textbook which an anonymous previous student has written in, giving Harry himself the upper-hand in school. In spite of his friends suspecting something bad about the book, Harry keeps using it to his advantage. There's also a lot  romance in this instalment of the series, thankfully not so much of the teen angst romance of the previous novel. While I've often heard from critics that the Harry Potter series is a lot of trivial fluff, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince definitely proves otherwise. Both a powerful coming-of-age story and a bridge from harmless fantasy to something a lot  mature and deep, this novel isn't my favourite one in the series but it's still one of the best ones to me, both in its character development and in the way it seems to parallel historical events in reality. The undercurrent of \"pureblood\" ideals, repressed freedom and corruption in authority bears an uncanny resemblance to WWII era Nazism, although the novel mostly keeps politics out of things, which is probably for the best since it leaves the story open to interpretation. There were a lot of striking revelations about characters and where they stand, bringing up whether Malfoy is truly as evil and callous as Harry initially thought, where Snape's loyalties lie, the secrets of Professor Horace Slughorn and what awaits the students of Hogwarts in the future.",

Another, large, part of the reason I love it so much is that you can see just how much Harry has matured and grown. I won't say too much here, because I don't want to spoil anything (for all two of you that haven't read the series yet). I remember the HUGE disappointment I felt for people that were spoiled about the BIG end before they'd been able to read it. I remember waiting in line to buy this book, and starting to read it on the way home (I wasn't driving - don't worry). I remember the tenterhooks that I was on while I read, trying to imagine how things were going to play out.And I have to say, this is probably one of the top two most satisfying books to re-read in this series (the other being Prisoner of Azkaban). There's so much nuance that you can catch after having finished the series. PoA shows you things almost immediately; HBP needs the last book to fully appreciate all the groundwork and clues and story laid down.Immediately upon finishing this book I thought: This is my favorite! I love it so much! But then I realized that I've said that about nearly every book in this series. So. There you have it. Another fabulous installment in the Harry Potter series. And now...the finale. The one that I anticipated like no other and dreaded just as much.Deathly Hallows here I come.",

A perfect book to boost your mental health. :)  *Updated Review After Re-Reading* Man... I just can't get over how grateful I am to have stumbled upon this series as a child. I know my review will be full of bias because these books mean a great deal to me. Hence, it is difficult to deconstruct them from a critical perspective. I mean, these books are the closest I, and many others, have gotten to magic. Not just in the story and writing, but the emotions this series evokes. Re-reading  \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\"  is a nostalgic and cathartic experience. It reminds me that Hogwarts is still my second home. In my opinion, this book in particular was a masterpiece. Despite knowing what happens, each time I crack this book open, it feels like I'm embarking on a fresh adventure. As a child, I loved these books because of the story. However, as an adult, I appreciate the moral themes and literary techniques . To this day, I can't get over how immersive the writing style is. When I read  \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" , every so often I forget I‚Äôm sitting in my dull, beige room and not at Hogwarts with the trio. This book was heart-wrenching. Rowling has a talent for creating characters with distinct personalities. They begin to feel real, which is why the reader becomes distraught when something bad happens to them. These characters taught me the importance of unity and the dire consequences of division. I hope to one day share the Harry Potter series with my children. I hope it will impart upon them the same positive lessons it taught me. Although this book is dark, Rowling balances the desolate tones with her clever sense of humour. I rarely laugh out loud while reading a book. However, each time I read this book, I find myself chuckling. Additionally, the plot is smart and intricate. I believe it is the perfect transcendence into the finale of this series, which is bound to give you so many feels.  *Previous Review* I have so many emotions right now... I had no idea it was even possible to feel this much after reading a book.  I hope this book review does not come out as a blubbering mess because I'm writing it through a filter of tears. This is my favourite book in the entire Harry Potter series. In my opinion, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince has the perfect amount of romance, humor, mystery and darkness to keep me interested. As an adult, I enjoyed reading this book much  than I did when I was a kid because the plot and characters are  complicated and multidimensional.  This book review contains spoilers  The reader gets to witness the turmoil and fear that has spread since the beginning of the Second Wizarding War. In the previous books, there was a clear separation between the magical and non-magical world. However, in this book, the reader gets to see the catastrophes of the two communities overlapping. Violent crimes are increasing, popular shops are closing down and people are going missing. The beginning of this book is also told from new points of views - the muggle Prime Minister, Narcissa Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange.  The characters in this book appear to be a lot  multidimensional.  Even the muggle Prime Minister is worried about the state of his country and I found his interactions with Fudge to be interesting. In many ways, the muggle Prime Minister appeared  competent and wiser than Fudge. I also liked seeing that the Death Eaters had a  sensitive side, albeit this does not make up for their intolerant and ruthless nature. But I sometimes forget that Lord Voldemort refuses to show mercy to even his dedicated followers. In fact, the family of Narcissa Malfoy is just as endangered (if not ) than any other wizarding family. Although I consider the fear Narcissa only has for her family to be selfish, the moment she made the Unbreakable Vow with Snape enabled me to understand that she is still a mother who worries about the safety of her offspring. It parallels the love Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon show Dudley on so many levels. I also enjoyed reading about the meeting with Professor Slughorn. In previous books, Slytherins had nearly no redeeming factors. But I loved Professor Slughorn! I think he added so much  complexity to the story. Although Professor Slughorn posses a lot of the characteristics Slytherin House values like ambition and resourcefulness, he does not join Lord Voldemort. His loyalty remains with Dumbledore and he has no desire to spread evil. His fondness of Lily Evans also reveals his lack of prejudice and intolerance for muggle-borns. Since the first few books were created for a younger audience, I understand why the Hogwarts Houses were portrayed as being pretty black and white. But in this book, we see a lot of characters that defy the stereotypes of their Hogwarts House. Another character I can think of right now is Zacharias Smith, who proves to be a total prat.  I also loved all the romantic bits in this book.  A lot of the characters are no longer children and nearing adulthood. It was so cute to see the bickering between Ron and Hermione. Since this book series was so long, it made the growth of their love feel organic. I mean, Ron was jealous of the relationship Hermione had with Victor Krum since the Goblet of Fire. But I think he always lacked in maturity and self-confidence before to acknowledge his feelings for Hermione. Despite their disagreements, their love grew from friendship and I find that to be beautiful.  \"It's been like...like something out of someone else's life these last few weeks with you.\"  It was also wonderful to see Ginny grow up to be such a strong woman. She starts off as shy, but as the book series progresses, I realized there was so much  to her than meets the surface. At first, I was doubtful about Ginny being with Harry, but re-reading this book made me acknowledge that she was the right girl for him. She loves Qudditch, has an excellent sense of humor and supports the decision Harry ultimately makes. The part where Harry reveals to Ginny that they can no longer be together warmed my heart. I know he sacrifices the opportunity to be with her out of care, but it was still heartbreaking to read about. It helps the reader acknowledge the unfairness of the situation Harry has been put into.  This book was hilarious and made me realize JK Rowling has an excellent sense of humor There were so many parts in this book where I stopped and laughed out loud. And let me say, that it is difficult for a book to make me laugh. I found the dialogue in this story to be so witty without trying to hard to be. I admire JK Rowling's writing so much for this reason. Even with the absence of Fred and George, I found Ron, Harry and Luna added so much light to this book. I think humor was important since the nature of the book itself was quite dark.  Learning about Tom Riddle's past was fascinating  Before this book, we know very little about the past of Lord Voldemort. Although we get glimpses of Lord Voldemort's past in previous books, it is still difficult to imagine Voldemort as a child or teenager. Although Lord Voldemort shares a lot in common with Harry, there are also a lot of key differences. Harry was born out of love while Tom was born out of infatuation. I have never pitied a character in this series the way I did Morphine. She appears lost and alone despite having a family. I do not believe Morphine was in the right state of mind when she infatuated Lord Voldemort's father. I think she was just desperate for a way to escape her situation and longed to feel the love her family neglected to give her. I also found it interesting how Lord Voldemort was showing evil tendencies from the start. In fact, he shows a lot of characteristics criminals show as children. The lack of empathy, hurting innocent animals, stealing items and taunting other kids. Lord Voldemort desires to be alone and has no friends or romantic interests. Although I feel bad that Riddle had to grow up in an orphanage, I think he was born with evil instincts. This is just my opinion based on my personal reading of this book since I understand the conditions of the orphanage were not ideal.  The ending was made me tear up This part that I'm about to review contains a major spoiler, so I recommend that you look away and close your eyes if you have not read this book yet since I would hate to spoil it for you. When Dumbledore passes away, it broke my heart. I do not think I have ever mourned the death of any fictional character like this. I think it is because Dumbledore seems impeccable. A lot of the characters saw Dumbledore as a source of protection. People say multiple times throughout the book that Hogwarts is safe because Dumbledore is there. But no longer having him there spreads fear and grief throughout the magical community. Although Dumbledore was old, he seemed like a character that could never be broken. I never thought that a killing curse would be enough to finish Dumbledore and I think at the time this book was published, neither did a lot of other Harry Potter fans. I think I cried most because of the way different creatures in the magical world responded to the death of Albus Dumbledore. He was someone who tried his best to use his power to rid the magical community of intolerances. He continued to strive and see the best in everyone. And despite his reverence, he never grew arrogant and continued to adorn a humble character. I think it many ways it made him as close as you could get to the ideal person. It is difficult to believe that the greatest wizard Harry, and many others, will ever know no longer exists in the world. But I understand the legacy Dumbledore left behind plays a crucial role in the next book. If you have not had the opportunity to read Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince yet I cannot recommend it enough. It is definitely one of the best books I have ever had the pleasure of reading and makes me grateful for my ability to read at all. Please give this book a read or a re-read! :)",
        "There is always so much going on in each of these books. There are always so many characters introduced, though most have a small part in the whole story. I really am enjoying this series and I have forgotten how great these books are compared to the movies. I did enjoy the movies, but the books are so much better.

There are always so many characters introduced, though most have a small part in the whole story. I really am enjoying this series and I have forgotten how great these books are compared to the movies. I did enjoy the movies, but the books are so much better. And I find myself not as connected to some characters in the books as I was in the movies and vice versa.This is an overall sad read. Rowling does not hold back in killing off prominent characters. I have enjoyed the growth of each character and getting to know each of them again. I love all the different relationships. Characters are so important to me when reading a story and Rowling is really great at developing her main characters. I definitely feel something for them whether it be love or loathing. And characters that once annoyed me, I find them growing on me. And not only me, but they grow on other characters as well. I love that; it feels like true human interaction.I always love the Weasley family; they are great people and I love them all but Percy, who is a twit! I despise the Mallfoy family as a whole as I find them really despicable. It is interesting to see how rotten children come from terrible parenting. There is Fleur who I found myself not liking since the Weasley family wasn't too keen on her. That is my loyalty coming out even while reading books; funny that! What Fleur does towards the end makes me love her no matter how annoyed I was with her. She is truly a beautiful person inside and it shines in the end. Another fantastic book that begins to bring the darkness closer in. The great loss leaves me feeling heartbroken. The final clash of good vs. evil is coming to a head. A great adventure begins with Harry and Dumbledore. I feel for Harry and how much he is burdened with, but he is an amazingly strong character even though his teenage whining sometimes gets to me. I do love this little group of friends.I truly love this series and the twists that it takes. If you love fantasy and magic I can't see why you wouldn't love this. My husband hates the Harry Potter series and after re-reading it just makes me even  confused as to how he can not enjoy it. Maybe it all boils down to the fact that he has never had children of his own and he isn't a fan of children or teenagers? What else could it be? This is a great series!",

That being said, this book is still enormously frustrating.The good:I really liked the memories. It's quite fascinating to get glimpses of Little Tom and his evil beginnings. There's a ton of new names to try and remember but it was nice to have some vastly different content for a change. In terms of the change of tone, the last book was almost like juvenile delinquency, whereas this book is  hardened criminal. The dark times are finally getting DARK and it almost kind of refreshes the series. There's still plenty of magic, but a lot of it is hexes and curses, and even though classes are still happening, we're given these flashbacks of dark times and evil people and it helps to finally bring a seriousness to the storyline that the previous books have been lacking. Plus, HI SNAPE. :D I love this guy so much, he's such a great character. Call me a horrible person, but I greatly enjoyed his shining moment at the end there. He's such a badass. (view spoiler)[Honestly, I was kinda sick of Dumbledore's secrets and irresponsible behaviour so really, Snape did me a huge favour. (hide spoiler)]Draco has a totally different role in this one, and it bothered me how much Harry obsessed over him. Poor Ron and Hermione, having to listen to Harry go on and on and on about it! I started to get bored reading about it, that's for sure. Draco seems pretty pathetic in this book, sadly. Not nearly the fun, antagonistic trouble maker of the past. I liked that he's kind of growing up though? Like he's one of few who have realised that life exists beyond the school. So props to him for that.Also loved the Prince's spell book. Like maybe that's partly because of my insider info on who the Prince is, but I love that this guy scribbles his own notes. What a genius. Way to fight The Man, man. You do you.The bad:Dumbledore. Is. A. Moron.THERE. I SAID IT.This guy is pretty freaking irresponsible for a teacher. He never explains anything, which is incredibly frustrating, and he guards all these ridiculous secrets for seemingly no reason. Instead of straight up telling Harry what he needs to know, he takes his time, showing him all these memories and never properly explaining the purpose. Plus, HARRY IS A KID. Why he is encouraging reckless behaviour in children is questionable. But also, he was going about this quest over the summer without Harry? So why does he suddenly need him? Like, maybe even sit him down and be like, 'look, Harry, I'd love to be the one to get rid of Voldy, but it's probably gonna have to be you. So I'm gonna destroy as many of these things as possible but if something bad happens to me, you'll have to pick up where I left off, alright?' But really, there are a ton of teachers at the school that could easily have helped Dumbledore and I still cannot comprehend why he roped in Harry. That right there is an unhealthy fixation. IT MAKES NO SENSE. That is my #2 issue with this whole series: there is no logic to the way Dumbledore behaves. (My #1 issue is Harry being an arrogant jerk and still having everyone in the world love him as he wins every battle and gets everything his heart desires with very few consequences.)I'm also curious about what the Order is actually doing during the events in this book. We're not really told a lot. Like, it's kind of weird that this book has so much school stuff when things are getting a bit out of control. The series is really bi-polar when it comes to its focus - it's got all this fun, magic school stuff, but then it also wants to focus on the world coming to an end. It's a bizarre combination. I get frustrated by how little the adults are involved, especially when magic plays such a big role because obviously the adults are going to be better at magic. Plus I like Remus and Tonks. They are fun. And of course this wouldn't be a review if I didn't moan about Harry a bit. He's still arrogant. He still ignores his friends. He still does stupid things. And now he's obsessing over Ginny, which, frankly, weirds me out a bit. (Ron took it far better than I would have.) But he also just has this complex where he seems to think he's above everyone. He rejects authority and constantly argues with teachers, and his lack of respect should have earned him expulsion by now. He's a total brat. No matter how many times he's told to leave things alone he still goes at it like a bull in a china shop. But then - and you'll notice this has been happening six books straight - he gets rewarded for it. No matter how badly or how often this kid screws up, he ALWAYS lands on his feet. Even just things like Hermione constantly doing his homework bug me. Plus I totally resent the fact that he got over Sirius so fast. My heart is still in pieces over here, you ungrateful sod. And no matter how many times his friends save his life or help him with things, he still thinks it's all about him. *eyeroll* I can't deal with this self-centred douchebag.I really admire Rowling's creativity and imagination, because I love the world she's built, but there is just so much flawed logic in the way this series is written. I think a lot of it feels like the series kind of got away from her - like it kinda just escalated til it wasn't so kid-friendly any  but she didn't quite know how to deal with that. Because when it comes down to it, this is a book about kids dealing with problems that should be handled by experienced adults, and there's really no decent explanation of why. It's a fun enough story, for sure, but if you stop and think about some of the explanations there are gaping black holes where logic should be.So skeptics like me will struggle a little, and the kiddies are probably gonna have a rough time with the dark turn things have taken, but I guess if you relax and let the story wash over you it's a rather interesting continuation of the series, with some valuable insights into the past.***Original delayed review:Ok so I'm not much of a Potter fan. Yes, maybe I devoured the series, one book immediately after the other, but I just got so frustrated with how moronic and conceited Harry is throughout the ENTIRE SERIES. We get it, you're super special and the fate of the world is in your hands. But you gotta chill out, son, and share the load with your friends.Also, think things through? Like, using someone else's notes was always gonna end badly. Do your own dang homework you lazy sod.Honestly, I should re-read the entire series so I can give sassy reviews with everything fresh in my mind but I feel like my HP hate might hurt some feelings.Snape is cool though, okay? I like him. I like him a lot  than big-headed Harry.",

I carelessly zoomed past my 600th read last year and didn't want this to happen again this time.‚§ê Overall.For a long time, I was one of these potterheads who just celebrated every word in the books and put the series on a pedestal. Nothing bad could have been possibly sad about these books. But, thanks to the amazing Harry Potter and the Sacred Text Podcast, I've learned to deal differently with the series and the author that have shaped my childhood and adolescence and continues to do so now that I am an adult (At least that's what the papers say. Whateverrr). The podcast has accompanied me for quite some time now and I'm incredibly grateful for it and the people who enrich my reading experience through it.My favourite aspect of this book is and has always been the fact that the side plot feels a lot like a teen comedy. The Half-Blood Prince is criticised for just that by many others but some like the idea so much (like me), they made a mock trailer for HP 6 in teenage spring comedy style. It shows that even in the darkest times, ordinary problems and joys still exist, and they are still relevant. ‚§ê Mayor issue.I'm not even sure whether this is the right book to bring this up but whatever. To me, Snape is not redeemable. I am and will always be mad at J for giving him a redemption arc, but not Draco. (I'll be mad at her for many things, mind you.) HOW does being friend-zoned justify abusing a child? Scratch that - generations of children? It doesn't. And it would be news to me that I can just torture a kid because one or both parents are insufferable twats. Yeah, fine, he risked his life, yadda yadda yadda. How about not tormenting children because your life is unfulfilled? I'm not saying Draco didn't do terrible things, but there's a difference between what a teenager can be redeemed for, and the span of forgiveness that should be mustered for a grown adult.‚§ê What‚Äôs happening.‚ÄòLet us step into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.‚ÄôWhile Harry continues to learn what it will take to bring down Tom Riddle, he also continues his journey into the realms of teenage drama.

This book is better than I remembered, and the history IS significant. It sets up the seventh perfectly and escalates the war and plot in ways no one could have guessed.The character development is astounding, and truly makes you take notice of how little you knew until this book. Dumbledore and Voldemort are fleshed out to an extent we hadn't seen before, and if possible, makes Dumbledore even  likable. He represents all that is good and loving and warm in the world, and Tom Riddle is his total opposite in every way. Voldemort is pure evil, but he never crosses the line of becoming a caricature of the villain. His torture of small children, his charm of the teachers, his murder of his own family, his desperation to achieve immortality at the expense of innocent lives, it almost overwhelms the reader to see such a character thrive in the wizarding world. Further, Slughorn was one of the best additions to the books and his likable smarm added humor and warmth to an occasionally chilling book. He wasn't loathsome like Umbridge, annoying like Lockhart, conflicted like Lupin. He knew exactly what he wanted and had no qualms using the kids to do it, and for some reason, it was highly enjoyable to watch his antics unfold.And, of course,  Ginny means  joy. She's by far one of the best characters in the entire series. Ginny represents strength and bravery arguably  than any other character in the series, and constantly looks after those that are bullied and belittled. In short, she's perfect.",

In fact, the whole book is inactivity; the plot consists of - get this - Harry learning about Voldemort's past. This is nothing that couldn't have been treated in other books with several asides, or even with Voldemort's own book. But no, Rowling felt that this needed to be spread incredibly thin over hundreds and hundreds of pages. She's still not a very good writer, and she badly needs a good editor. There's no reason for one, though; at this point, Rowling could sell the phone book under the title Harry Potter and the Unlisted Number and it would probably sell millions. As for The Half-Blood Prince, 300 pages could easily be removed from its text without anybody - the author included - noticing.",

This is, of course, the main focus of the movie. To me, the movie adaptation of this book is the worst of them all since it almost exclusively focuses on the teenagers‚Äò love affairs instead of on at least one of the other, exceedingly important, issues such as the discoveries regarding Voldemort‚Äôs past (I loved travelling through time thanks to the pensieve), trying to get Professor Slughorn‚Äôs memory even against his will, or the quest for the titular Half-Blood Prince. I remember not having had read the book before seeing the movie for the first time and being extremely confused the first few seconds after the Half-Blood Prince revealed himself. This journey, following all the clues, seeing how much Harry actually learns (which gives him and Snape a cool dynamic and a new twist on the ‚Äûdark arts‚Äú) was highly enjoyable. The only thing they really showed in perfect likeness and gave enough screen time in the movie was the twins‚Äò joke shop. Oh, and then there is also the whole Dobby-and-Creature-dynamic which was hilarious and quite important (although we only get to see that in the next book). And let‚Äôs not forget the story between Harry and Creature what with the whole inheritance from Sirius. All that before the background of ever  numerous disappearances and killings, Voldemort gaining  and  influence and dread spreading, but also some funny/quirky happenings like the apparition test where Ron leaves behind half an eyebrow or the incident with the love potion on Ron‚Äôs birthday or Aragog‚Äôs burial or the constant bickering between the Weasley women and Fleur or Luna commentating the Quidditch match which has to be one of the funniest things ever. Overall, the atmosphere in the book, despite everything that is going on in the outside world, is much  homely again. Especially in comparison to the previous volume this is not just a stark contrast but also a welcome relief. Well, at least until the shocking and dark conclusion. By the way: (view spoiler)[Harry and Hagrid finding Dumbledore lying on the ground - and the students coming outside and seeing the body as well - after the Death Eaters have gone, is at least as bad as the actual moment of death; apart from Fawkes‚Äò lament maybe. *sobs* But the impact of the movie scene when everyone raises their wand to illuminate the night is still the most profound; the book cannot rival that. (hide spoiler)]In this context, it is so immensely sweet how the author (through Molly and Fleur and McGonagall) makes her point that especially when the world is dark, love is what is needed the most. *sniffles*A brilliant way Rowling showed how much Harry has grown up (probably without realizing it himself) was the discussion with Scrimgeour, the new Minister for Magic, at the Burrow and later at the funeral. What is , it was a great way to simultaneously show the ambiguity of the wizarding world - the supposed good guys doing  and  unforgivable things with the excuse of just reacting to the new threat. Sneaky and significant on many levels (and as comparing the time of this book‚Äôs publication with current times shows, the writing seems to never lose its significance). Harry also learns a lot from the lessons with Dumbledore and I‚Äôm not talking about the contents of the memories now ‚Äì it‚Äôs rather his way of thinking and plotting and finally connecting the dots and realizing the role he has to play (though not entirely just yet). Not to forget his realization that there is a difference between having to fight and choosing to do so (with your head held high).In this book, then, we get  action than ever before (yes, I‚Äôm thinking of the extremely impressive cave scene and the fight with the Death Eaters that was severely downplayed in the movie),  riddles than before,  entanglements. As the children in the series are growing up, so are the readers, and so the themes get darker and  complex too. It is another stroke of genius on Rowling‚Äôs part. Just like the casually strewn hints that, in retrospect, lead to so much  than just the main story here (as we discover now when watching the Fantastic Beasts movies). The world she has created has so much depth, one could drown in it. And it doesn‚Äôt stop there as I know from several interviews the author has given.If I wasn‚Äôt so determined to complete the series and see all the threads coming together, I might need a few days of respite after the immense loss we have to cope with at the end of this book. But alas. Onwards!P.S.: It really was a shame that they didn't show the funeral in the movie! I especially liked the Centaurs' and Merpeople's contribution.",

That is going to be my word for this book because it totally ‚Äúwowed‚Äù me! Honestly, i was feeling really disappointed after finishing Order of the Phoenix and i was wondering ‚Äúis this it for me and Harry Potter books?‚Äù but oh no, this book was unputdownable, i just couldn‚Äôt get enough of it. Everything that was lacking from the last book, came back into this one and i am so pleased!J.K Rowling found her groove again, and the writing style is completely gripping! I like how she started off the book from a couple of different POV‚Äôs to really hook us in and make us want to know what the heck is going on! She gave away just enough information from those perspectives to make us literally question everything throughout the book and i loved that mystique element to the writing. The humour is also back in this one, and I‚Äôm so glad. The last book was so gloomy and put me in a dispiriting mood, and even though this book is far from Happy-go-lucky, it had some hilarious, and beautiful moments that befitted the story.Another thing that is greatly touched upon in this book is the magical elements. We get a lot  of in-class scenes that focus on learning different magic, and it‚Äôs probably one of my favourite parts. I just love learning along with the rest of the class and seeing how all the different paths work together. There is a significant chunk of this book where Harry is learning a lot  in potions and i found it so fascinating to read those parts because in previous books the actual ‚Äúpotion making‚Äù is on the back burner and it‚Äôs mostly focused on how Harry hates those classes because of Snape.You can also tell that the characters are getting older and maturing by the ‚Äúraging hormones‚Äù throughout this book. There‚Äôs fights, drama, love, and typical hormonal teenage stuff that really adds to the realistic qualities of the book. It‚Äôs not all just about magic, or dark arts, these are real teenagers going through the same ups and downs we have all experienced in life.The characters really do come into themselves in this instalment. We already know who are main characters are and their surface qualities; however, this book takes it a step further than the rest and really gets nitty gritty into the raw emotions of our beloved characters. We learn a lot  about them and i got to say its really great. Not only do we get  of our main characters but we finally get  Ginny. Who i personally really like: she‚Äôs smart, witty, and a great person. Finally, her character is expanded upon.My favourite part of this book is the meetings between Harry and Dumbledore. For the most part, Dumbledore has only really come into the books towards the end and it‚Äôs always as  of a role model figure towards Harry. Now we get to see them as sort of friends and it‚Äôs really amazing to see the bond between them. Also, Dumbledore is pretty badass, he‚Äôs not just the humble old man we‚Äôve seen in previous books, and i am thrilled that we get to see him in action.What actually takes place at these meetings is also what makes these encounters my favourite. We get so much  information on what and why things are going the way they are and its done in such a clever manner. Through conversations, J.K Rowling has totally dumped a gargantuan amount of information on us but made it to feel natural. Although overwhelming at times, she did it in a way that you would come across in real life and made it to be engaging rather than off-putting. She is such a clever writer and it comes across in the best of ways.I honestly have such a fondness for this book, and i can‚Äôt decide whether i like this one or Prisoner of Azkaban better. The writing, plot, characters and magic all comes together to make for one amazing read. If you‚Äôre having trouble getting through any of the other books, trust me, it‚Äôs worth it to get to this one!Larissa",

So, somehow the review was never written , but no damage done because one of the Harry Potter perks is that not even a tiny detail is ever Forgettable . The story starts as always with the Dursleys . this time Dumbledore has a trip for Harry before he settles in the burrow and then back to Hogwarts . as the events progresses Harry is lent a potions book by Professor Slughorn, an old friend of Dumbledore's who they convince to step by their side and eventually teach potions in Hogwarts . in the book Harry finds a number of notes from it's previous owner, which allows Harry to excel in a subject he has never been  than average at. The book is marked \"Property of the Half-Blood Prince\". Who's this half blood prince , the potions brilliant ? Hermione is slightly suspicious but they have too many other things in mind to bother much about it . Harry is a little affronted by Dumbledore's disinterest in his doubts and fears . anyways soon we'd be introduced to what's called Horcruxes  and dive in their mysteries .I love this book , its fast paced , nothing seems safe any , everything is at risk even Hogwarts that has always been the safe haven . its quite dark at places . the flashbacks that tell us about Voldemort's / Tom Riddle's past is so absorbing . I always like to read the stories of the villains , I like to know what led them to be whatever they are .Also in this book we can notice that Rowling seems to be trying for  complicated prose and  sophisticated storytelling than each of her previous books . There are plenty of questions left unanswered by the end and We also learn a lot  about the characters, We even see whole other sides of them , maybe change our model thinking about them . Draco Malfoy is one of these . The final plot twist , which is Dumbledore's killer identity is absolutely unforeseen even shocking {if it's not spoiled for you , off course } and Dumbledore's death overall is devastating , the one who was always been there to solve problems , the background Hero , their savior , the strongest wizards in the world's Death puts everything at stake . His death is one of the most emotional . The only two deaths that made me cry were Dumbledore's and Dobby's . Though I have to admit that if I had the choice to bring one character to life that most definitely would be Fred , but when I say emotional I mean that we had time to cry , to mourn our loss . Fred 's , Sirius's , Lupin's , Tonks's . All these deaths happened in the middle of a battle , in the middle of a sentence we had no time to feel them fully at the time .But Later they'd hurt when Re-reading the books or when thinking about the whole image but while reading You'd feel Dumbledore's and Dobby's the most . At least that's what happened with me . Yes ! off course Dobby is still alive here , also all the other characters above but I am generally speaking .

This book easily has my favorite beginning chapters before Harry goes to Hogwarts, and once again, we get to see so many fun things happen at Hogwarts as school is back to normal after the disaster it had become in the fifth book. I love that after such a dark tone in the fifth book, we get a lot of humorous moments and excitement over  mediocre things like relationships and Quidditch in this one. It was a refreshing breather after the fifth book, and exactly what you need before diving into the final installment of the series! I also have to say I found a new appreciation for Ginny in this book. Her sarcastic personality is honestly one of my favorite parts of the book and led to a lot of laughs as I reread. Also seeing just how much she has developed as a character over the entirety of the series has honestly made her one of my favorite character developments so far. If anything, I just want even  of her! I am so sad my reread is soon going to come to an end, as I am once again so invested in this world I love, and it is honestly one of my greatest achievements that I have found a series that can bring me such joy when reading it even after all these years.",

To make room for that history lesson, most of the usual crowd (Hagrid, Neville, Luna, McGonagall, Remus, Fred, George, etc) have smaller parts. There is a side plot for Ron dealing with teen age romance, but since that boils down to the standard \"Ron is a useless git\" theme it isn't very satisfying.This is also a book of lost opportunities to mature Harry. In book 5 Harry had to become a leader, but this book generally allows Harry to duck out of making hard choices. As Quidditch captain, fortunate events twice let him avoid choosing between team members. In romance, fortunate events lead him to a girl basically falling into his arms. In school, fortunate events let him slide through potions class with little effort. Symptomatically, in one scene where Harry needs his own blood for magic, he fortunately scrapes himself just moments before. Maybe I'm missing the point and we are supposed to understand that Harry isn't anyone special, he's just very very lucky.",

You have got to give JKR credit for the way she fleshes out all of her characters, even the most hated of villains has got a backstory. \"Did you know -- then?\" asked Harry.\"Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark wizard of all time?\" said Dumbledore. \"No, I had no idea that he was to grow up to be what he is. However, I was certainly intrigued by him. I returned to Hogwarts intending to keep an eye upon him, something I should have done in any case, given that he was alone and friendless, but which, already, I felt I ought to do for others' sake as much as his.\"Despite the fact that this book is still a bit darker and has taken a turn for the serious, you can also see the growth that the characters all go through as they get older and  mature (in some ways) and take  note of the world around them and begin to develop romantic interest in others. This book covers the prophecy  and sets up the journey Harry has to undertake in the final installment so well. My emotions are all over the place...and this is a re-read!! I already know how it all goes, but I love getting to feel everything over again. I remember being completely wrecked after reading this for the first time and realizing how long of a wait I had before the 7th book came out! Luckily, I already have The Deathly Hallows waiting on me to just finish this review.\"Don't you see? Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different! Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him. He heard the prophecy and he leapt into action, with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him, he handed him uniquely deadly weapons!\"And, as always, so many wonderful quotes to take note of:\"There is nothing to be feared from a body, Harry, any  than there is anything to be feared from the darkness. It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing .\"\"People find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right.\"\"Killing is not nearly as easy as the innocent believe.\"Off to my re-read of Deathly Hallows now...wish me luck everyone!But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew--and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents-- that there was all the difference in the world.",
        "‚ÄúHe accused me of being Dumbledore's man through and through.\" \"How very rude of him.\" \"I told him I was.\" Dumbledore opened his mouth to speak and then closed it again. Fawkes the phoenix let out a low, soft, musical cry. To Harry's intense embarrassment, he suddenly realized that Dumbledore's bright blue eyes looked rather watery, and stared hastily at his own knee.

When Dumbledore spoke, however, his voice was quite steady. \"I am very touched, Harry.‚Äù Harry Potter the Half-Blood Prince pushes up the amplitude of the crescendo that is the Potter series to the beginning of the stages for the final book. The book in itself is mostly a tribute to the paternal relationship between Dumbledore and Harry, as over the years Harry has had many guardians/teachers/mentors, but none quite at the level of Albus Dumbledore. Many scenes depict them together delving into the backstory of Tom Riddle, aka Voldemort, who Harry will have to confront and defeat as predicted in the prophecy. And what an interesting backstory it is, peeling back the layers of Riddle's own youth and rise as the dark lord bent on shaping the wizarding world in his image. The heartfelt ending is both tragic and gripping, making readers want to dive into book seven: the Deathly Hallows. Romantically we are still teased to the feelings between Hermione and Ron, something that becomes both frustrating and a bit comedic as Ron and Lavender's intimate levels of public affection are laid forth. Ron, rather foolhardily, wishes to catch up to both Harry and Hermione in the love department, but we as an audience feel the pain of jealously Hermione is forced to deal with over Ron's new girlfriend. This however isn't the most shocking of romance plots in the book. Who knew Harry would fall for Ginny Weasley!? It's cute.It was also interesting to see Harry further blossom into  of a leadership role, something he really began with \"Dumbledore's Army\" in the Order of the Phoenix. Him becoming captain of the Quidditch team and taking  responsibility within both Hogwarts and alongside Dumbledore are really rewarding to readers of the series whom have followed him along every twist and turn. He's using his vulnerabilities  wisely and gaining confidence where he needs to, but still displays that recklessness we've come to know him by. The recklessness is on full display with his investigations into Draco Malfoy and his supposed new allegiance to Voldemort. The addition of a new character, Horace Slughorn, was well thought out and it was a joy to see his place in the story of Hogwarts, alongside the identity of the person who holds the title that this book is named after. That whirlwind of emotions felt at the end of the book bring determination to continue on to the last book in the series.",

I don't think the movie is better then the book, I simply think the director did a better job at getting me to like certain aspects where the author failed.I have to say this will always remain my least fave book of the entire series. It loses some of that comfort that all the five before it do though never the magic. It just aint as good as any of the other six, with too much forced teenage romance like there's nothing natural about it, its beaten over the head consistently that Hermione and Ron are in love with one another where they have zero chemistry between them and should have always just been friends, Harry suddenly has random feelings for Ginny he never had before and is not shown, his feelings are told and being told them so forcefully dosent make them believable, honestly the way Harry obsesses over Draco and the rising tension between them over the years they have something between them  then anyone else. I have never shipped any canon Harry Potter couple except Molly and Arthur who have been married for years, couples already set but the ones Rowling makes I don't agree with. I just dont think she makes a great romance because honestly every other relationship-family, friend etc I love but her romantic pairings and the way they're written just no. I ship so many non canon ships in the universe however, if you read between the lines they are so many. Honestly romance in fantasy lets me down a lot of the time and my dislike of the romance and its drama in this book really knocks it down a few notches. I have to say though Fleur makes me laugh when Bills scarred and shes like, im beautiful enough for both of us, is so funny and the only romantic thing I liked. And I am grateful that unlike a lot of fantasy the bad romance doesn't take up much page time.",

So then comes the 6th book's release, and by this time, I'm just as rabid for it as everyone else. I need to know what's happened. I need to know whether Sirius... but no. What I really need to know is What Will Harry Do Now? The day comes, and, at the time, I was working a late shift. I got out of work at 11:15pm, raced to the bookstore for the midnight release... and found it closed, dark, and the parking lot nearly empty when I got there at 11:30. OH! I was LIVID. I immediately, literally standing in the parking lot, called the bookstore and ripped the manager a new one. The book releases at MIDNIGHT. I HAD A PRE-ORDER!! You don't get to sell it early just because you don't feel like being there into the early hours of the morning! I was so angry that Mr. Sheepishly Apologetic Bookstore Manager even offered to reopen the store for me. I refused on principle. (What? He made me mad and I just wanted him to know it. Though, honestly, if I was really feeling vindictive, I should have made him re-openThe summumabeech.)What does this story have to do with anything? Nothing much, except to establish my almost desperate frame of mind... I NEEDED that book. But I knew they'd be available everywhere. That night, there were so many copies of Half-Blood Prince around that I could practically have snagged one off of a passing owl. And just as an aside, I'll tell you that when the 7th book came out a couple years later, that bookstore was open and selling them properly. I take personal credit. Not that I was there... I went to a different store, again on principle. Because I hold grudges like that. ;)Anyway, with my new acquisition, I raced home, told my boyfriend he had to go out with his friends so that he didn't disturb me, and I devoured the book in hours. And it was like... a cool drink of water after you've been thirsty for a long time. I HAD A NEW HARRY POTTER BOOK! But after finishing, I was like, \"Eh, it's just a filler, bridge to the last book, book.\" I wasn't disappointed - don't get me wrong. I had loved it. But I am admitting that it took me a couple reads to really, REALLY appreciate it properly. All the things that we learn, all the ways that this book brings all the things that we'd seen in the first 5 books together, how Harry finally realizes what it all means and what he'll have to do, how he can't just hope to keep defending himself and those he loves, but knows he'll need to go on the offensive if he hopes to win... It was all amazing, brilliantly woven together into this awesome next-to-last book. When Harry tells Ron and Hermione about the real prophecy, and he is grateful to them for not shrinking away from him as though he'd suddenly turned leprous, it hits home just how alone Harry truly is. I never expected them to do differently... but Harry feared they might. It shows how much of a complex Harry has about his role in everything - he's always been alone, separate, so it surprises him that his friends would stick by him. And even at the very end, he is again surprised when they refuse to let him shrug them off and take the Horcrux Hunt onto his own shoulders completely. Harry. Harry... You have better friends than you can possibly know. What I wouldn't give for friends that would stand with me like that, time after time after time, and in the face of such danger and fear. Silly boy. I also love Snape in this book. He's as much of a jerk as always, but in the chapter where he's running from Hogwarts, when he screams at Harry not to call him a coward, how his voice is described, how he's STILL trying to teach Harry, but Harry is too full of blind rage to hear, to think, to learn... It's... brilliant. Harry reaches his conclusions and refuses to see any other alternative, despite what Dumbledore has exemplified year after year - openmindedness, trust, understanding. Damn, I love this book. Just amazing. ",

Also while the end of this one doesn't make me sob uncontrollably like OotP, it's still definitely very emotional and very well written. I wish that there wasn't so much 'romance' and Harry's ~chest monster~ has to be about the worst thing I've ever seen outside of a fanfic, but I just gloss over all that and concentrate on that sweet sweet side character action.

        "Alright. Let's do it. I have finally decided to go through the effort and write proper reviews for the Harry Potter books. I will review the series as a whole first, (pointing out why I absolutely love them) and then go through each book separately. I know that probably every person on goodreads has already written a review for these books, but I think I wanna add my part as well. So, why do I love these books? Obvious reason, I grew up with them. I read the series as a child, as an adolescent, Alright. Let's do it. I have finally decided to go through the effort and write proper reviews for the Harry Potter books. I will review the series as a whole first, (pointing out why I absolutely love them) and then go through each book separately. I know that probably every person on goodreads has already written a review for these books, but I think I wanna add my part as well. So, why do I love these books? Obvious reason, I grew up with them. I read the series as a child, as an adolescent, and as an adult. Actually I re-read them (or better to say, re-listen to them) every year, throughout the year. So I'm biased. I'm all the way FOR Harry Potter. Second reason, I think these books are very well-written. Characters are beautifully developed and very real, and they make you feel all sorts of emotions throughout the book. I have loved and hated most of the characters as they make their way through the series. They have all been pains in the ass AND been wonderful humans. To me, they remain very 'real'. Third reason, the magical world of JKR as absolutely to die for. I know, it has many loop holes and flaws, but it's just lovely. Now I want to comment on the Half-Blood Prince shortly. This book has been one of my favorites (and sometimes my absolute favorite) of the series. As of 2019, it ties the first place with Goblet of Fire. I love how dark and ominous the general theme of this book is. The central theme is \"shit just got real\": Voldemort's openly back, there's an inevitable war coming, and the nice fuzzy Hogwarts of book 1 is almost completely gone, it's now a cold castle where Malfoy roams about doing some evil god-knows-what, Snape's roaming around doing god-knows-what, Fred and George are not there any to be the comic relief, there are no letters from Sirius any, and there's nothing fun going around any. I think this book has matured from the previous ones. Harry is not the insufferable ass that he was in book 5, he has grown up a lot, he's become calmer and a lot  likable. I seriously love Harry in this book. I love the plot twists of this book. JKR throws some clues very early on (like the cabinet being seen at Borgin and Burk's) but you don't realize the importance of them until almost the end of the book. Snape's character development climaxes in this book, and the ending just leaves you with a numbing feeling of excitement, sorrow, horror and uncertainty about what is going to happen next. The first time I read the series I picked up the last book right after finishing this one, (as I'm not old enough to have been one of the original generation readers) and I cannot imagine the anguish people went through between the release of books 6 and 7. It's absolutely nerve-wrecking. I have a lot  to say about this book, but I haven't listened to it in a while, So I'll need to come back and edit this review later. But generally, here's a list of things I loved: (spoilers!)- Harry is Quidditch captain. Love it. - Harry and Ginny: Thank God we don't have to put up with Cho freaking Chang any!- Slughorn's potion classes. Yesss. I always thought potions could be such an interesting subject if it weren't for Snape. This year we got a real taste of it. - Snape being DADA teacher. I always wanted to see him in this position, actually. I never hated Snape throughout the books, I found him rather comically hilarious and intimidating at the same time, and I always wanted to know what his DADA classes might be like! - frequent visits to Dumbledore's office. I mean, who doesn't love that? It absolutely sucked in the last book when Dumbledore was avoiding Harry. - The first two chapters. Very interesting. All that business with the other minister and getting to see Snape's home. - The Half-Blood Prince. I mean, isn't he a life saver for Harry? - Felix Felicis: by far the best and most interesting potion ever to be mentioned anywhere. I want a bottle of it so badly. - Hermione. Of course. As Always. - Ginny. She's amazing! very witty and smart. - Fred and George's shop. It's absolutely the reason to live, and it is to die for as well.- Malfoy actually doing something important other than walking around with Crab and Goyle and bullying people. Malfoy's character gets somewhat interesting and real in this book and I really appreciate that. - Tonks and Remus. I mean. My heart. - The last four chapters. They are so intense. For me, they are  intense than those battle scenes in Game of Thrones. The battle. The aftermath. The scene at the hospital wing with everyone feeling guilty. It's so well written. So heart breaking. So human. - The funeral: the way centaurs and merfolk show up to pay their respects. - Neville and Luna. They have always been amazing, but I love them so much in this book. I think that's it for now! This is surely to be edited and updated when I read it next time. Or,  precisely, I will let Stephen Fry do his magic and read it for me.",

        "Well the Goblet of Fire was dark, the Order of the Phoenix was darker... So how was the Halfblood Prince?

Does the trend continue?Before we get stuck into the review, here's the quick obligatory plug. Yes, I read a lot of fantasy. I also write it. I'm currently working on 'Deathsworn Arc 6: Emergence'. If you like fantasy, please check out my books!     Right! So how was Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince?Well, I'll be honest, I was concerned about this book. My son began reading the Harry Potter series when he was about 5 or 6? Something like that? He read the first three books himself and most of the fourth book. The thing is, I've seen the series and I read the books to my daughter who's slightly older. I know how the story goes. It starts out fairly light-hearted and gets progressively darker. The first big impact being during book 4 when [SPOILER WARNING!] Cedric Diggory got killed. I knew from the series that the battle of wills with Umbridge and the death of [SPOILER ALERT!] Sirius were pretty intense. So I insisted on reading Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix to him. It took a while, it was a LONG book. But we both enjoyed it. My son wasn't disturbed at all by the book and he started Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince immediately after reading it - again, with me reading it to him. I'd expected to have to censor bits of Phoenix and Halfblood, but as I was reading, it occurred to me that this stuff is less visceral in the written form and nowhere near as disturbing as the screen presentation. So I didn't censor anything. I do think [SPOILER ALERT!] Dumbledore's death had  emotional impact on my son that Sirius. It's a really dark turn in both the book and the series.For the most part however, things seem to be going better for Harry during this book. He's respected and liked at school - even with girls fawning over him and trying to sneak him love-potion laced chocolates! His friendships with Ron and Hermione are stronger and he's got an enduring, but lesser friendship with the likes of Luna and Neville. The looming OWL exams have passed and there's less pressure on the trio academically. A dominating theme of this book is Harry's obsession with Malfoy. He's suspicious right from some early scenes in Diagon Alley that Malfoy is up to something. His friends continually urge him to drop his suspicions. However [SPOILER ALERT!] it turns out Harry's fears were well founded. You can really feel Harry's frustration as he plays a Cassandra, tormented to know the truth, but for nobody to believe him.Another key plotline is the relationship between Ron and Hermione, and Harry and Ginny. Early in the book Ron dates a girl called Lavender. But their relationship seems very shallow and base. Harry spends a lot time pining over Ginny and wistfully regretting the fact that she's dating Dean Thomas. It turns out of course, that Ginny has pretty much always fancied the pants off Harry. Ever since that rather awkward moment when they first met and she just stood there, silent and blushing. Hermione has been encouraging her behind the scenes to do things that might make her  able to speak to Harry and not be so awed by him. It seems like from Ginny's perspective Dean was just a practice run. Used mainly as a means of training her up to date Harry. Of course, this side of the story I think didn't really have the full emotional impact on my son. He turned 8 around a month ago and at Primary School they don't really talk about dating and girlfriends much. Having read this book, if he remembers it, he way well be better prepared for these pitfalls at high school. Though, seeing as it's looking likely he could end up at an all-boys school, the issue might not rear its head for a long time.The biggest plot in this book is really Dumbledore's meetings with Harry and exploration of the Pensieve. We finally get some real insight into who Voldemort is, who Tom Riddle was and how he became the most evil dark wizard in the history of the magical world. Merope I think had the most tragic tale and really, you feel like Voldemorts fate dominoed from the sad end that Merope met after her miserable life and upbringing. We now know what Horcruxes are and after a dash of Felix Felicus courtesy of Professor Slughorn and USED to get information from Professor Slughorn - we know where Riddle's obsession with immortality began. Two Horcruxes have been destroyed. The Diary from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets being one of them and a Marvollo Gaunt's ring being another (As well as the cause of Dumbledore's withered hand.) Harry and Dumbledore quickly surmise what some of the remaining Horcruxes are but also that they don't know all of them. This sets the stage for the end game.The scene with the inferi where they recover the locket was fantastic. I think the screenwriters did a great job of translating it though. The conversation between the Death Eaters and Dumbledore on top of the tower was... Complex. I know how the story plays out and I understand Snape's role in it. To be honest during this scene I thought the truth of Snape's relationship between Dumbledore and Voldemort was well-hidden. I don't think you could unravel the reality behind the facade from this scene, or indeed this book.My son wants to immediately read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows but I think it's darker still. I think it's time he took a break from the wizarding world and read something else. The other two paperbacks sitting on his bedside table and TBR list are The 1,000 Year Old Boy and The Weirdstone of Brisingamen. I'm not sure which he'll read first. He'll probably finish both within a couple of months. He'll then start mythering for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Do I cave in and get it him? Or do I try and get him to wait until he's 9? This is a tough call. I remember the story being particularly dark at times. But then he's been fine with the other books so....I'm going to call it. My son loved this book and I did too. I think this was a better book than Phoenix or Goblet. I think it's one of my favourite of the series. Why? There's a lot going on. There's several complex interwoven plots happening, but it feels like this book is all thriller and no filler. Phoenix and Goblet, had lots of bunf in them. Maybe it was necessary bunf? And don't get me wrong they were great books. However there were times when I was reading them and wishing Rowling would just 'Get on with it!' so to speak. I think they were perhaps a little too long. Still great books - sure. But I think Halfblood comes across as a  polished and harder put down novel. It's a pacier book and a real page-turner almost all the way though.So a definite 5 stars. The question is, when do I let my son read 'The Deathly Hallows'? (He's also reading Tin as his school book at the moment, but he'll have finished that in a week or so.)Martyn Stanley",

Possibly one of the largest spoilers of all time. At least in terms of people being upset finding it out before reading it. I remember being at a convention the year this came out and people seemed to be making it a point of yelling (view spoiler)[Snape kills Dumbledore (hide spoiler)]. I put that in tags on the very slim chance you either haven't read the book, or somehow avoided that. If you did, I'm impressed. Tell me what your secret is please!People got really creative about this too. I remember someone did a mashup with castaway where Tom Hanks was keeping a copy of the book in that unopened package and then someone flew by the island with the spoiler on a banner behind the plane.I also recall just before the final book came out, people who preordered from Walden books had their choice of bookmark one saying (view spoiler)[Trust Snape (hide spoiler)], and the other: (view spoiler)[Snape is a very bad man (hide spoiler)]. I think I was  in the former camp, than the latter, but it's hard for me to remember any.Above all I think this division among readers during what felt like a very long waiting time until Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows came out, is what is best about this book. It is certainly THE cliffhanger of the series.Also, in this book, Ms. Rowling finally starts to reveal some of the deeper secrets of the series as Harry and Dumbledore explore memories of the past.As a grown adult, I find the descriptions of (view spoiler)[Harry's feelings toward Ginny (hide spoiler)] both amusing and nostalgic. I remember having similar feelings when I was I was high school. I don't miss that \"monster\" as Harry calls it.",

        "I remember when this book was originally released. I'd gotten into the Harry Potter phenomenon late, after the 5th book was out, and during the time before Half-Blood Prince was out, I'd read and re-read the first 5 books... A LOT. So then comes the 6th book's release, and by this time, I'm just as rabid for it as everyone else. I need to know what's happened. I need to know whether Sirius... but no.

I'd gotten into the Harry Potter phenomenon late, after the 5th book was out, and during the time before Half-Blood Prince was out, I'd read and re-read the first 5 books... A LOT. So then comes the 6th book's release, and by this time, I'm just as rabid for it as everyone else. I need to know what's happened. I need to know whether Sirius... but no. What I really need to know is What Will Harry Do Now? The day comes, and, at the time, I was working a late shift. I got out of work at 11:15pm, raced to the bookstore for the midnight release... and found it closed, dark, and the parking lot nearly empty when I got there at 11:30. OH! I was LIVID. I immediately, literally standing in the parking lot, called the bookstore and ripped the manager a new one. The book releases at MIDNIGHT. I HAD A PRE-ORDER!! You don't get to sell it early just because you don't feel like being there into the early hours of the morning! I was so angry that Mr. Sheepishly Apologetic Bookstore Manager even offered to reopen the store for me. I refused on principle. (What? He made me mad and I just wanted him to know it. Though, honestly, if I was really feeling vindictive, I should have made him re-openThe summumabeech.)What does this story have to do with anything? Nothing much, except to establish my almost desperate frame of mind... I NEEDED that book. But I knew they'd be available everywhere. That night, there were so many copies of Half-Blood Prince around that I could practically have snagged one off of a passing owl. And just as an aside, I'll tell you that when the 7th book came out a couple years later, that bookstore was open and selling them properly. I take personal credit. Not that I was there... I went to a different store, again on principle. Because I hold grudges like that. ;)Anyway, with my new acquisition, I raced home, told my boyfriend he had to go out with his friends so that he didn't disturb me, and I devoured the book in hours. And it was like... a cool drink of water after you've been thirsty for a long time. I HAD A NEW HARRY POTTER BOOK! But after finishing, I was like, \"Eh, it's just a filler, bridge to the last book, book.\" I wasn't disappointed - don't get me wrong. I had loved it. But I am admitting that it took me a couple reads to really, REALLY appreciate it properly. All the things that we learn, all the ways that this book brings all the things that we'd seen in the first 5 books together, how Harry finally realizes what it all means and what he'll have to do, how he can't just hope to keep defending himself and those he loves, but knows he'll need to go on the offensive if he hopes to win... It was all amazing, brilliantly woven together into this awesome next-to-last book. When Harry tells Ron and Hermione about the real prophecy, and he is grateful to them for not shrinking away from him as though he'd suddenly turned leprous, it hits home just how alone Harry truly is. I never expected them to do differently... but Harry feared they might. It shows how much of a complex Harry has about his role in everything - he's always been alone, separate, so it surprises him that his friends would stick by him. And even at the very end, he is again surprised when they refuse to let him shrug them off and take the Horcrux Hunt onto his own shoulders completely. Harry. Harry... You have better friends than you can possibly know. What I wouldn't give for friends that would stand with me like that, time after time after time, and in the face of such danger and fear. Silly boy. I also love Snape in this book. He's as much of a jerk as always, but in the chapter where he's running from Hogwarts, when he screams at Harry not to call him a coward, how his voice is described, how he's STILL trying to teach Harry, but Harry is too full of blind rage to hear, to think, to learn... It's... brilliant. Harry reaches his conclusions and refuses to see any other alternative, despite what Dumbledore has exemplified year after year - openmindedness, trust, understanding. Damn, I love this book. Just amazing. ",

Also while the end of this one doesn't make me sob uncontrollably like OotP, it's still definitely very emotional and very well written. I wish that there wasn't so much 'romance' and Harry's ~chest monster~ has to be about the worst thing I've ever seen outside of a fanfic, but I just gloss over all that and concentrate on that sweet sweet side character action.

        "Alright. Let's do it. I have finally decided to go through the effort and write proper reviews for the Harry Potter books. I will review the series as a whole first, (pointing out why I absolutely love them) and then go through each book separately. I know that probably every person on goodreads has already written a review for these books, but I think I wanna add my part as well. So, why do I love these books? Obvious reason, I grew up with them. I read the series as a child, as an adolescent, Alright. Let's do it. I have finally decided to go through the effort and write proper reviews for the Harry Potter books. I will review the series as a whole first, (pointing out why I absolutely love them) and then go through each book separately. I know that probably every person on goodreads has already written a review for these books, but I think I wanna add my part as well. So, why do I love these books? Obvious reason, I grew up with them. I read the series as a child, as an adolescent, and as an adult. Actually I re-read them (or better to say, re-listen to them) every year, throughout the year. So I'm biased. I'm all the way FOR Harry Potter. Second reason, I think these books are very well-written. Characters are beautifully developed and very real, and they make you feel all sorts of emotions throughout the book. I have loved and hated most of the characters as they make their way through the series. They have all been pains in the ass AND been wonderful humans. To me, they remain very 'real'. Third reason, the magical world of JKR as absolutely to die for. I know, it has many loop holes and flaws, but it's just lovely. Now I want to comment on the Half-Blood Prince shortly. This book has been one of my favorites (and sometimes my absolute favorite) of the series. As of 2019, it ties the first place with Goblet of Fire. I love how dark and ominous the general theme of this book is. The central theme is \"shit just got real\": Voldemort's openly back, there's an inevitable war coming, and the nice fuzzy Hogwarts of book 1 is almost completely gone, it's now a cold castle where Malfoy roams about doing some evil god-knows-what, Snape's roaming around doing god-knows-what, Fred and George are not there any to be the comic relief, there are no letters from Sirius any, and there's nothing fun going around any. I think this book has matured from the previous ones. Harry is not the insufferable ass that he was in book 5, he has grown up a lot, he's become calmer and a lot  likable. I seriously love Harry in this book. I love the plot twists of this book. JKR throws some clues very early on (like the cabinet being seen at Borgin and Burk's) but you don't realize the importance of them until almost the end of the book. Snape's character development climaxes in this book, and the ending just leaves you with a numbing feeling of excitement, sorrow, horror and uncertainty about what is going to happen next. The first time I read the series I picked up the last book right after finishing this one, (as I'm not old enough to have been one of the original generation readers) and I cannot imagine the anguish people went through between the release of books 6 and 7. It's absolutely nerve-wrecking. I have a lot  to say about this book, but I haven't listened to it in a while, So I'll need to come back and edit this review later. But generally, here's a list of things I loved: (spoilers!)- Harry is Quidditch captain. Love it. - Harry and Ginny: Thank God we don't have to put up with Cho freaking Chang any!- Slughorn's potion classes. Yesss. I always thought potions could be such an interesting subject if it weren't for Snape. This year we got a real taste of it. - Snape being DADA teacher. I always wanted to see him in this position, actually. I never hated Snape throughout the books, I found him rather comically hilarious and intimidating at the same time, and I always wanted to know what his DADA classes might be like! - frequent visits to Dumbledore's office. I mean, who doesn't love that? It absolutely sucked in the last book when Dumbledore was avoiding Harry. - The first two chapters. Very interesting. All that business with the other minister and getting to see Snape's home. - The Half-Blood Prince. I mean, isn't he a life saver for Harry? - Felix Felicis: by far the best and most interesting potion ever to be mentioned anywhere. I want a bottle of it so badly. - Hermione. Of course. As Always. - Ginny. She's amazing! very witty and smart. - Fred and George's shop. It's absolutely the reason to live, and it is to die for as well.- Malfoy actually doing something important other than walking around with Crab and Goyle and bullying people. Malfoy's character gets somewhat interesting and real in this book and I really appreciate that. - Tonks and Remus. I mean. My heart. - The last four chapters. They are so intense. For me, they are  intense than those battle scenes in Game of Thrones. The battle. The aftermath. The scene at the hospital wing with everyone feeling guilty. It's so well written. So heart breaking. So human. - The funeral: the way centaurs and merfolk show up to pay their respects. - Neville and Luna. They have always been amazing, but I love them so much in this book. I think that's it for now! This is surely to be edited and updated when I read it next time. Or,  precisely, I will let Stephen Fry do his magic and read it for me.",

Does the trend continue?Before we get stuck into the review, here's the quick obligatory plug. Yes, I read a lot of fantasy. I also write it. I'm currently working on 'Deathsworn Arc 6: Emergence'. If you like fantasy, please check out my books!     Right! So how was Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince?Well, I'll be honest, I was concerned about this book. My son began reading the Harry Potter series when he was about 5 or 6? Something like that? He read the first three books himself and most of the fourth book. The thing is, I've seen the series and I read the books to my daughter who's slightly older. I know how the story goes. It starts out fairly light-hearted and gets progressively darker. The first big impact being during book 4 when [SPOILER WARNING!] Cedric Diggory got killed. I knew from the series that the battle of wills with Umbridge and the death of [SPOILER ALERT!] Sirius were pretty intense. So I insisted on reading Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix to him. It took a while, it was a LONG book. But we both enjoyed it. My son wasn't disturbed at all by the book and he started Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince immediately after reading it - again, with me reading it to him. I'd expected to have to censor bits of Phoenix and Halfblood, but as I was reading, it occurred to me that this stuff is less visceral in the written form and nowhere near as disturbing as the screen presentation. So I didn't censor anything. I do think [SPOILER ALERT!] Dumbledore's death had  emotional impact on my son that Sirius. It's a really dark turn in both the book and the series.For the most part however, things seem to be going better for Harry during this book. He's respected and liked at school - even with girls fawning over him and trying to sneak him love-potion laced chocolates! His friendships with Ron and Hermione are stronger and he's got an enduring, but lesser friendship with the likes of Luna and Neville. The looming OWL exams have passed and there's less pressure on the trio academically. A dominating theme of this book is Harry's obsession with Malfoy. He's suspicious right from some early scenes in Diagon Alley that Malfoy is up to something. His friends continually urge him to drop his suspicions. However [SPOILER ALERT!] it turns out Harry's fears were well founded. You can really feel Harry's frustration as he plays a Cassandra, tormented to know the truth, but for nobody to believe him.Another key plotline is the relationship between Ron and Hermione, and Harry and Ginny. Early in the book Ron dates a girl called Lavender. But their relationship seems very shallow and base. Harry spends a lot time pining over Ginny and wistfully regretting the fact that she's dating Dean Thomas. It turns out of course, that Ginny has pretty much always fancied the pants off Harry. Ever since that rather awkward moment when they first met and she just stood there, silent and blushing. Hermione has been encouraging her behind the scenes to do things that might make her  able to speak to Harry and not be so awed by him. It seems like from Ginny's perspective Dean was just a practice run. Used mainly as a means of training her up to date Harry. Of course, this side of the story I think didn't really have the full emotional impact on my son. He turned 8 around a month ago and at Primary School they don't really talk about dating and girlfriends much. Having read this book, if he remembers it, he way well be better prepared for these pitfalls at high school. Though, seeing as it's looking likely he could end up at an all-boys school, the issue might not rear its head for a long time.The biggest plot in this book is really Dumbledore's meetings with Harry and exploration of the Pensieve. We finally get some real insight into who Voldemort is, who Tom Riddle was and how he became the most evil dark wizard in the history of the magical world. Merope I think had the most tragic tale and really, you feel like Voldemorts fate dominoed from the sad end that Merope met after her miserable life and upbringing. We now know what Horcruxes are and after a dash of Felix Felicus courtesy of Professor Slughorn and USED to get information from Professor Slughorn - we know where Riddle's obsession with immortality began. Two Horcruxes have been destroyed. The Diary from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets being one of them and a Marvollo Gaunt's ring being another (As well as the cause of Dumbledore's withered hand.) Harry and Dumbledore quickly surmise what some of the remaining Horcruxes are but also that they don't know all of them. This sets the stage for the end game.The scene with the inferi where they recover the locket was fantastic. I think the screenwriters did a great job of translating it though. The conversation between the Death Eaters and Dumbledore on top of the tower was... Complex. I know how the story plays out and I understand Snape's role in it. To be honest during this scene I thought the truth of Snape's relationship between Dumbledore and Voldemort was well-hidden. I don't think you could unravel the reality behind the facade from this scene, or indeed this book.My son wants to immediately read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows but I think it's darker still. I think it's time he took a break from the wizarding world and read something else. The other two paperbacks sitting on his bedside table and TBR list are The 1,000 Year Old Boy and The Weirdstone of Brisingamen. I'm not sure which he'll read first. He'll probably finish both within a couple of months. He'll then start mythering for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Do I cave in and get it him? Or do I try and get him to wait until he's 9? This is a tough call. I remember the story being particularly dark at times. But then he's been fine with the other books so....I'm going to call it. My son loved this book and I did too. I think this was a better book than Phoenix or Goblet. I think it's one of my favourite of the series. Why? There's a lot going on. There's several complex interwoven plots happening, but it feels like this book is all thriller and no filler. Phoenix and Goblet, had lots of bunf in them. Maybe it was necessary bunf? And don't get me wrong they were great books. However there were times when I was reading them and wishing Rowling would just 'Get on with it!' so to speak. I think they were perhaps a little too long. Still great books - sure. But I think Halfblood comes across as a  polished and harder put down novel. It's a pacier book and a real page-turner almost all the way though.So a definite 5 stars. The question is, when do I let my son read 'The Deathly Hallows'? (He's also reading Tin as his school book at the moment, but he'll have finished that in a week or so.)Martyn Stanley",

Possibly one of the largest spoilers of all time. At least in terms of people being upset finding it out before reading it. I remember being at a convention the year this came out and people seemed to be making it a point of yelling (view spoiler)[Snape kills Dumbledore (hide spoiler)]. I put that in tags on the very slim chance you either haven't read the book, or somehow avoided that. If you did, I'm impressed. Tell me what your secret is please!People got really creative about this too. I remember someone did a mashup with castaway where Tom Hanks was keeping a copy of the book in that unopened package and then someone flew by the island with the spoiler on a banner behind the plane.I also recall just before the final book came out, people who preordered from Walden books had their choice of bookmark one saying (view spoiler)[Trust Snape (hide spoiler)], and the other: (view spoiler)[Snape is a very bad man (hide spoiler)]. I think I was  in the former camp, than the latter, but it's hard for me to remember any.Above all I think this division among readers during what felt like a very long waiting time until Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows came out, is what is best about this book. It is certainly THE cliffhanger of the series.Also, in this book, Ms. Rowling finally starts to reveal some of the deeper secrets of the series as Harry and Dumbledore explore memories of the past.As a grown adult, I find the descriptions of (view spoiler)[Harry's feelings toward Ginny (hide spoiler)] both amusing and nostalgic. I remember having similar feelings when I was I was high school. I don't miss that \"monster\" as Harry calls it.",

And I haven't written Rowling off my list of authors I will read. However, I don't agree with what she did. Annette tells me it's necessary for the story. But that doesn't mean I have to like it.

I think I just did not wanted it to happen, let them just be friends that care a lot about each other.. But how obvious can it get. Oh and Harry and Ginny is like.. ugh. That monster in his belly, really? And how selfless of him to quit the relationship at the end, and what a perfect timing, at a funeral.. AHUM.

Not to mention (view spoiler)[Draco's involvement in his death and the reveal that he has also been working as a Death Eater for the school year. (hide spoiler)] So while a lot of things happen and are revealed, that all really only happens in the last 50 pages. The other 600 pages were filled a little too much with potion work, Slughorn's memory, Lavender Brown, and the fulfillment of a romance I never saw panning out.So anyway, some pacing issues aside, this is still a fantastic book in a nearly perfect series",

Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince often gets a rap as the least-liked book in the series, where Harry is the most whiney and obnoxious. In this sixth book of the series, Harry appears very self-involved, constantly stirring over his Potions books, that formerly belonged to the mysterious Half-Blood Prince. He is also torn romantically, pining over someone he doesn't feel he should.Ron and Hermione are at odds for most of the book, neither one wanted to admit or be honest with the other about the true nature of their relationship.Despite Harry becoming Quidditch caption, the game is one of the last things on his mind.And yes, there is that weird stalker-ish obsession Harry has with Malfoy that no one, even Ron and Hermione, think is rational.But despite all of Harry's observable faults in this book, I think it is close to the top of the list as my favorite. I didn't used to think so when I was younger (I was 16 when HBP first came out), but reading it now, nine years later, it is clear that this book is so incredibly complex and detailed.As always, the last 100 pages of the book proved almost too *intense/full of feels*, for lack of a better term, to take. I cried even though I knew what was coming because I love these characters so much, they are part of me.I am very anxious to finish The Deathly Hallows soon so I can go back and marathon all the movies and take notes on my opinions regarding the adaptations of my favorite series!So in summation, there just simply isn't anything like HP for me.

It's true! Yes, this might've been influenced by the fact that I heard so much bad stuff about him, but I never outright heard that he was an actual fully-fledged Death Eater. (Which, by the way, makes about 0 sense in my opinion. \"Death Eater?\" Like, you consume death? You obtain energy from death? That last one might be it, but still. Very strange moniker.) Anyway, yeah, back to Snape. Even though in book 5, when Harry started taking the Occlumency lessons with Snape, we all - and again I just mean I - hoped that Snape would bond with Harry???? Because he was supposedly on the good side???? And that would be super cute to be honest???? But deep down, or at least once Snape didn't forgive Harry for finding that memory, we concluded he was evil through and through. You can probably tell that I was super annoyed that no one believed Harry when he suspected Snape and Draco of being Death Eaters, even though it was super obvious. I feel like in this book, the doubt everyone had of Harry's ideas was less realistic because they were pretty accurate, but that's just my opinion. (Throwback to my Book 2 review when I said I liked Snape and Draco, hah! How naive I was back then, a few weeks ago.)I liked the idea of the Horocruxes, and I feel like, had that theory been introduced earlier on, the entire series could have been centered around them. I guess in a way, it was. But it is an interesting concept and it adds a lot  of the expected mystery aspect of the Harry Potter Books. As a big romance-lover, the last 5 books were okay, but I wasn't as fulfilled as would've been had there been  romance/drama. (That's actually kind of a lie because they were just as if not  engaging than the stuff I usually read - but that's a given. I just needed a good intro.) Nevertheless, I enjoyed this book fractionally better because of the romance and drama added. Ron and Hermione and all their drama was super funny and cute. And Harry and Ginny I've been rooting for since Book 1, too (never mind that I had outside influence on that as well). Hope to see Harry and Ginny back together by the end of the series.Back to what I said at the beginning, I am pretty pissed that JK Rowling killed off Dumbledore, yet another of my favorite characters. It seems that I just seen someone my favorite and she makes it a priority to kill them - even though these books were published like ten years ago. First Sirius, now Dumbledore, who's next - Hagrid? WAIT, forget I said that. (Ew that was so cheesy and forced.) Dear JK, please don't kill anyone else I love, thanks! I'm pretty apprehensive of the next book, as can be expected, but I've actually heard that there's going to be an eighth book. Who it's about I have yet to know since I haven't finished the seventh, but I'm pretty excited anyway.",
        "After all these years, after all this time, I still find myself crying on a train, while turning the last pages of this book.Honestly, it was stupid to think tears could be avoided. I should have known how Dumbledore always gets to me. How his pleading words, the apparent betrayal of Snape, the rightness and yet wrongness of Harry's assumptions affect me. After all, no book has ever made me cry as hard as this one; no book has ever made me doubt anything as much as this one. ‚ÄúWhen you have seen After all these years, after all this time, I still find myself crying on a train, while turning the last pages of this book.Honestly, it was stupid to think tears could be avoided. I should have known how Dumbledore always gets to me. How his pleading words, the apparent betrayal of Snape, the rightness and yet wrongness of Harry's assumptions affect me. After all, no book has ever made me cry as hard as this one; no book has ever made me doubt anything as much as this one. ‚ÄúWhen you have seen as much of life as I have, you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love.‚ÄùThis installment in the series is a thing of wonder. While Rowling has an unforgiving tendency to portray her characters in black and white, good and evil, she introduces a bit of grey in this one. One after one, Harry sees his idols fall, his enemies betray a hint of humanity and his sense of right and wrong gets confused along the way. He finds himself uttering unforgivable curses, wrestles with jealousy and most of all, he finds himself to be a helpless witness to his worst fear. Harry grows up in this book. His heroes fall. Dumbledore turns out to be a mere human; Draco Malfoy proves himself to be afraid of the darkness he has entered into; and  importantly, Voldemort is revealed to have been Tom Riddle, an orphan with thieving tendencies. No one is left on a piedestal. No one is spared. This realization hits Harry and the reader with full force in the tearful ending. A phoenix sings, a life ends, and Harry is once again left alone, chasing after guesswork and vague clues. ‚ÄúI make mistakes like the next man. In fact, being ‚Äì forgive me ‚Äì rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.‚Äù More than anything, I consider this book to be about realising the humanity in others. Whether they are a magnificent larger-than-life teacher with a white beard and wise words for any occasion, a privileged bully ‚Äì or a man who has split his soul in a multitude of killings.It's so well done.(view spoiler)[And even though this book has its issues, such as the stereotyping of Lavender Brown as a crying, needy giggling girl with no feelings worth caring about, the sudden relationship between Harry and Ginny only ignited by jealousy or the occasional (but never explained or mourned) horrors inflicted by the newly-risen Voldemort, I still consider it one of the best in the series. It's hard not to. (hide spoiler)]‚ÄúLet us step into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.‚Äù",
        "And since I only had two  books in the series to read, and the last 70 pages of  Empire of Storms by Sarah J.

It's dark without being too dark, a lot of the characters who were just unbearably angsty in the previous book are  like their old selves, Hagrid is barely in the book, and there's almost as little Quidditch in it as the previous book. It's like all of my complaints about Order of the Phoenix are gone now with this book. I really enjoyed learning about Voldemort's past and how he became the dark lord, and Harry's time with Dumbledore. Although I found the whole \"he was always evil, even as a child,\" thing to be a bit lazy on the side of the author. She never really shows a turning point, a place where he turns bad, he was just always that way. I really like that Fleur, who has previously come off as pretty shallow, was abhored by the idea that she would leave Bill just because his face got torn up. The looks into Snape's past are pretty good too, and very subtle, in that you probably won't really see them on the first time through the book. I also really enjoy the ending of this book. The betrayal and death, the fight through the school and down onto the grounds after retrieving the fake Horcrux. I was so disappointed when the movie came out and it was like four people that invaded Hogwarts, and like just Harry trying to fight them off. I mean, this was a huge fight with dozens of people trying to kill each other, and destroying the school around them, and in the movie, Helena Bonham Carter skips around being Helena Bonham Carter and vandalizes the place before they walk out the front door. Whoopie. Whoever made that decision for the end of the movie needs a good kick in the ass. I also like how the love stories are used to bring levity to a pretty dark story, and don't really overstay their welcome. Thank god, a YA writer that understands that a love story SUBplot is a SUBplot, and not the main plot.Anyway, if you've recently stepped into our dimension from a parallel universe where Harry Potter doesn't exist and have never heard of it before, please pick it up. It's a pretty fun and entertaining series for what it is.",
        "‚ÄúAnd Harry saw very clearly as he sat there under the hot sun how people who cared about him had stood in front of him one by one, his mother, his father, his godfather, and finally Dumbledore, all determined to protect him; but now that was over.

He could not let anybody else stand between him and Voldemort; he must abandon forever the illusion he ought to have lost at the age of one, that the shelter of a parent‚Äôs arms meant that nothing could hurt him. There was no waking from this nightmare, no comforting whisper in the dark that he was safe really, that it was all in his imagination; the last and greatest of his protectors had died, and he was  alone than he had ever been.‚Äù This. BOOK. Half-Blood Prince is the dark horse of Harry Potter novels for me. My appreciation of it has only grown since first reading it on the night it was released to the world those many years ago. I greatly enjoyed it, but was so devastated by the events at the end of the book, still broken apart with grief from Sirius' end in Order of the Phoenix and overwhelmed by emotions throughout reading this book that I associated it with those darker emotions for a long time after reading it. I think the darker tone of Half-Blood Prince has always blinded me to how much I thoroughly enjoy it every time I re-read it. Somehow, I keep forgetting! I'm going to keep this review short, as I want to move onto reading Deathly Hallows this evening and there not much to say about this book that hasn't already been said probably much  eloquently. J.K. Rowling does some of her best work in Half-Blood Prince, combining all of the elements that we expect and love from the Harry Potter series: mystery, grief, obsession, romance, family, antics, surprise, and sacrifice. LET'S CHAT ABOUT THE ROMANCE IN THIS BOOK, SHALL WE. First: Ginny and Harry's relationship is perfect, so well-developed, and I will fight anyone who disagrees with me. Their connection is so wonderful and I love the slow-burn of it to get to this point. They both believe in each other so much and are incredibly like-minded - but different enough to keep each other in check. Harry and Ginny understand each other at a deeper level than anyone has ever understood either of them. I love the quote during Dumbledore's funeral where Harry realizes that Ginny would never try to argue with him about going after Voldemort. It is so important for their relationship and he respects her so much. The sadness that Harry feels upon separating from her for her own safety, to not want to lose her like so many others, is palpable upon reading the end of Half-Blood Prince. But Ginny showing her determination for their own paths leaves me even  confident in how well paired they are. Second: Ron and Hermione murder me. It kills me how much of a mess they are because of their jealousy. They truly bring out the best and worst in each other, always. During this whole book, the reader is just screaming MAKE OUT ALREADY because these stubborn idiots refuse to get their shit together. I love it. Third: Bill and Fleur are so cute. So. Cute. I love how the team comes around to Fleur in the end and understands that their prejudice prevented them from seeing how Fleur truly loved Bill. Fourth: Tonks and Lupin are EVERYTHING. They hit every single one of my favorite romance tropes and I love how they are slowly developing throughout this book in the background, unbeknownst to the reader and Harry until the very end. The Half-Blood Prince's potions book is a fun element in this novel, as is Slughorn's exclusive Slug Club. I always appreciate Slughorn giving us  information about Lily Potter and his personality is unique. The switching of posts between Snape and Slughorn is entertaining, with Snape finally getting what he has always wanted. Can we acknowledge that the curse on the DADA post still stands, as of the end of this book? Freaking Tom Riddle. Draco's mission can get a bit tiring while reading, mostly because of Hermione and Ron and everyone else's frustrations with Harry about it, but really is wonderfully crafted. You feel pity for him but also intense anger at how he opened the door for such violence at Hogwarts. Hints placed throughout that Harry picks up on leave you wanting . FINALLY, THE HORCRUXES. It was so bold of Rowling to not let this plot point creep out any earlier than book six, especially having to develop it so quickly in Half-Blood Prince to leave room for the Deathly Hallows reveal in the next book. I think it is explained fairly well through Dumbledore's \"lessons\" with Harry and the chase of Slughorn's memory. Dumbledore's fate in this book is always excruciating. As much as I have a bone to pick with him, for reasons the reader doesn't learn of until the final installment of the series, the absence of Dumbledore from this point forward is truly impactful. The quote at the top of this review really sums up how the reader and Harry feel at the loss of the headmaster. It allows for Harry to rise as the true hero of this story from this point forward, as Dumbledore prepared him for the road ahead and primed him (a bit less than I would have liked, but we'll get to that after book seven) for his role in this story. It's hard to really understand how central Dumbledore has been in Harry's life and the narrative of these books until he is ripped from us. The funeral allows for some closure and retrospection that I really appreciate. Related: We'll talk  about Snape after book seven. I always have so many mixed feelings about him. I really think that this book has become my current favorite in re-reads of this series. Order of the Phoenix will always be my all time favorite because of the memories and connection I have with it, as well as the focus on Sirius, but this book checks  of my \"love\" boxes in recent years that any of the others. It does a fantastic job of telling a self-contained mystery, doing some deep relationship development, and setting up the finale of Harry's story beautifully. \"I am not worried, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. \"I am with you.‚Äù",
        "Another brilliant book from J K Rowling. As I‚Äôve said before in my other reviews I love these books. Although this one is darker and sad at the end it‚Äôs still an enjoyable read. Probably in 2 or 3 years I will read the whole series again. But for the moment I have one  to go.",
        "‚ÄúDo you remember me telling you we are practicing non-verbal spells, Potter?\"\"Yes,\" said Harry stiffly.\"Yes, sir.\"\"There's no need to call me \"sir\" Professor.\"The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying.‚Äù",
        "‚ÄúIt is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing .‚Äù"
